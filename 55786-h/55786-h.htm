<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book is intended chiefly for the home. It is an
aid to parents in introducing their children to some of the
best stories in the world. It will be of obvious value also
to Sunday-school teachers, ministers who preach to children,
public-school teachers, kindergartners, librarians,
and to all who perceive that the story method is the
golden method of teaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can I find suitable stories to tell?&#8221; is a frequent
question asked by lovers of children who take
seriously their cry of soul-hunger, &#8220;Tell me a story!&#8221;
Oral story-telling within recent years has had a remarkable
revival, and a response to both the child&#8217;s and the
parent&#8217;s plea has been made in a number of charming collections
of children&#8217;s stories and manuals on the art of
story-telling. But it is well known that books of stories
with material in a form readily adapted for telling are
very few. Fewer still have attempted to gather into one
volume those old favorites which should be the heritage
of each succeeding generation of children. True, there
are collections in many volumes, such as &#8220;The Children&#8217;s
Hour,&#8221; in ten volumes; the &#8220;Junior Classics,&#8221; in
ten volumes; and the series, &#8220;What Every Child Should
Know,&#8221; in twenty volumes; but these, admirable in many
respects, are bulky, expensive, and forbidden to all except
the favored children of the rich. Mothers frequently
ask for something condensed, comprehensive, and simple.
It is to meet such a need, often expressed to him, that
the author has gathered, during a number of years of
experience in moral and religious education, these World
Stories for telling to modern boys and girls.</p>

<p>Almost all of the many stories in this book he has
himself told at various times before differing audiences
of children, young people, and adults&mdash;audiences
varying from one or two open-eyed listeners in the home,
or the little group in the country Sunday-school or wayside
schoolhouse, to the large classes and assemblies in
high schools, colleges, city libraries, Sunday-schools,
churches, and conventions. In many cases children and
young people have retold these stories in almost the exact
language here given.</p>

<p>The principle on which these stories have been adapted
and rewritten is largely that of condensation. There is
undoubtedly a certain cultural atmosphere created in the
very language and spirit of these fine old tales, but the
descriptive adornments often lead to a length that is
unattractive to the busy mother or teacher, as well as
trying to the strength of mind and memory of the child.
Given the real facts, illustrating the moral principle desired
to be imparted, the story-teller may elaborate as
much as imagination, interest, and time permit. After
such an early introduction in childhood to these stories
that for unnumbered generations have furnished food
to mind, memory, heart, and will, the boy and girl will
experience a keener joy in after years when the fuller
versions are read in the original or in larger books.</p>

<p>In the preparation of these pages, the author has been
favored with the generous counsel, aid, and encouragement
of specialists in child psychology, pedagogy, and
story-telling, among whom mention must be made especially
of Dr. Richard Morse Hodge, of Columbia University,
one of whose articles printed in &#8220;Religious Education&#8221;
suggested this work; Dr. Henry F. Cope, Secretary
of the Religious Education Association; John L.
Alexander, Secondary Division Superintendent of the International
Sunday School Association; and my friend,
Dr. Irving E. Miller, of Rochester University, and author
of &#8220;The Psychology of Thinking.&#8221; To these, as well as
to a host of teachers and principals of public schools,
pastors and superintendents in churches, and mothers and
fathers in homes, who so graciously permitted experimentation
with these stories, gratitude is sincerely expressed.</p>

VALUE OF STORIES</h3></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Stories</span> are the language of childhood. They are
mirrors of nature in which the child beholds his
natural face &#8220;as in a glass.&#8221; They appeal to every instinct
of child nature. They feed every interest of the
soul. They strike a responsive chord in every awakening
faculty of the unfolding life. Boys and girls love stories
as they love no other form of address. Stories afford
amusement and entertainment as play does, for they are
the mind&#8217;s play, as well as its natural soul-food.</p>

<p>Story-telling is as old as human speech. It was enjoyed
by the primitive children of all races and lands, as
it is enjoyed by the boys and girls of to-day. There is
no better way to convey our ideas, to widen knowledge,
experience, and sympathy, or to impress moral truth.
Stories with plenty of life and action in them leave nothing
to explain. Conduct pictured in them needs no application
or obtrusive moral. Good stories, well adapted and
well told, not only furnish amusement and hold attention
as no other form of speech does, but possess positive
value in many other directions. They feed, exercise, and
cultivate the imagination; appeal to the emotions; arouse
the will; strengthen the power of concentration; develop
the sense of beauty; stimulate the idealizing instinct;
help to shape thought and language; widen the child&#8217;s
sympathies and fellowships; broaden his world interests;
prepare for future understanding of literary classics,
especially poetry; implant ideas of right and wrong; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
in short, make the most lasting impressions of an ethical,
esthetic, educational, and cultural nature.</p>

<p>The story method is the golden method of instruction.
No method of teaching is so popular or powerful. The
story-teller was the first teacher of primitive children in
Egypt, Assyria, India, China, and Japan. The stories of
the wandering bards, like Homer, in ancient Greece, were
the first education of the Greeks. Stories of national
heroes, such as we find in Plutarch&#8217;s Lives, delighted the
Roman boy just as the stories of Joseph and Samuel and
David and Daniel charmed and thrilled to patriotism the
Jewish boy. During the Middle Ages the monks, troubadours,
skalds, jongleurs, wandering bards, and minstrels
never lacked an audience when they told or sang
their tales of mystery, heroism, or love. Story-telling
has been a valuable instrument for philosophers, poets,
prophets, statesmen, and great leaders of men in all
ages. It was the method of Jesus, the greatest of all
teachers. &#8220;Without a parable spake he not unto them.&#8221;
Plato regarded stories for children as so important that he
would have none told that had not been approved by the
public censor. Froebel, the father of the kindergarten,
said: &#8220;Story-telling refreshes the mind as a bath refreshes
the body; it gives exercise to the intellect and
its powers, and tests the judgment and the feelings.&#8221;
Charles Lamb, Sir Walter Scott, Robert Burns, Coleridge,
Longfellow, Dickens, Emerson, Lowell, Milton,
Hawthorne, Stanley, Hugh Miller, Ruskin, and Wagner
tell of the influence of stories, and especially fairy stories,
upon them before the age of sixteen, and many before
they were twelve. When Henry Ward Beecher arose in
Manchester, England, to make an address, during the
Civil War, pleading the cause of the Union before a
bitterly hostile assembly, he looked out upon a howling
mob. He smiled, he waved his hand, he waited in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
At last he shouted, &#8220;Let me tell you a story!&#8221; and at
once the tumult ceased. He told them a short, pithy
story in half a dozen sentences, won their attention, and
proceeded with his great plea for human rights. It has
been said that Beecher, by this speech, stemmed the tide
of popular feeling against the Union and so prevented
recognition of the Confederacy by the British Government.</p>

<p>All the world loves a good story. But give the story
a place in the heart and mind of childhood early enough,
and you have laid the foundation-stone for an enduring
character. And beyond all this, as Dr. G. Stanley Hall
says, &#8220;To hear stories from the great story-books of the
world is one of the inalienable rights of childhood.&#8221;</p>


<h4>STORIES IN THE HOME</h4>

<p>Elementary teachers, junior librarians, and competent
Sunday-school teachers are now fully expected to meet
the story-hunger of childhood by good stories. But
educated mothers also are coming to realize that these
workers for their children cannot be expected to do all
the story-telling. Parents, and especially mothers, should
talk with their children about the stories they have heard,
and supplement these with the cultural classics, such
world stories as are found in this collection, or with those
from other sources.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mother&#8217;s heart is the child&#8217;s best schoolroom.&#8221;
The home is the first and holiest school. The home is
the institution which is more important and fundamental
than all others. Teachers, ministers, and other educators
can cooperate with, but can never be substitutes for,
educated, cultured parents, who, by the great law of
family life, necessarily exert the most direct influence
upon the life of the child, and especially during its formative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and most impressionable years. An educator of
wide reputation says: &#8220;If, at the end of the sixth year,
the child has not acquired self-control and a fair ability
to be an agreeable member of society, it is the fault of
the home. A failure to arrive at such a happy state of
affairs may be due to economic or social conditions back
of the home, but normally this responsibility for the care
and training of children lies with the parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>Because so few mothers feel competent to cooperate
in this creative art of story-telling, such a course should
manifestly become an integral part of the education of
every young woman of culture. This is, in part, being
provided, and soon must universally find a place in the
curricula of high schools, normal colleges, State universities,
and denominational institutions of learning.
Many who are now mothers have had no such training.
All the greater reason, therefore, that the mother who
would be competent should avail herself of such books
as &#8220;Stories and Story-Telling,&#8221; by E. P. St. John; &#8220;How
to Tell Stories to Children,&#8221; by Sara Cone Bryant;
&#8220;Stories and Story-Telling,&#8221; by Angela M. Keyes;
&#8220;The Children&#8217;s Reading,&#8221; by Frances J. Olcott; &#8220;Some
Great Stories and How to Tell Them,&#8221; by Richard T.
Wyche; or &#8220;The Moral Instruction of Children,&#8221; by
Felix Adler. Any one of these books, or the present
volume alone, will assist any mother to improve her opportunity
of telling stories to her own children or to
develop her own natural gift into a conscious art, so that
ability may fit opportunity more perfectly.</p>

<p>It is well for the mother to have a definite plan for
children&#8217;s story-telling. Some mothers I know have set
aside half an hour in the morning after breakfast, when
the husband has gone to the office and her older children
have gone to school, as the best time for what they call
&#8220;the morning stories of the Bible&#8221; (early chapters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of Genesis) for those who are in the early morn of life.
Less fortunate mothers have set aside Sunday afternoons.
Others set aside a half-hour after supper on two or three
evenings each week, or even one evening, if that is all that
can be spared. Still others devote, faithfully, one-half
hour to their children&#8217;s story-telling before the children
go to bed, or even after they are in bed, and the children
love that half-hour as &#8220;the best of all the day.&#8221;</p>


<h4>THE FATHER AS STORY-TELLER</h4>

<p>The instinct of story-telling is, undoubtedly, more
natural with the mother, the children more necessarily
turning to her with their cry for soul-food, &#8220;Tell me a
story!&#8221; But many a father would greatly enrich his own
life and his boy&#8217;s childhood memory by less absorption
in the evening paper, the monthly magazine, or the club
in order to attend to this soul-hunger of his boy&#8217;s mind.
Longfellow, the great lover of children, had the father
as the story-teller in mind, when he pictured &#8220;The
Children&#8217;s Hour&#8221;:</p>

<p>Not all fathers are so occupied with business cares that
they may not, if they would, attract their children and
strengthen and ennoble their life by stories. Not a few
fathers I have known have left this priceless heritage
and memory to grateful children.</p>

<p>When should parents begin to tell stories to their children?
As early as possible. When should they cease?
At no point. Walter T. Field, in &#8220;Finger Posts for
Children&#8217;s Reading,&#8221; tells of a father who read a course
in history with his sons when they were grown into young
manhood. Not the least reason for the father, as well as
the mother, being the story-teller to their own children,
is the comradeship of it. A well-loved writer once said
that in his long experience he had never seen any family
of boys go wrong where their father was their &#8220;chum,&#8221;
if the father was himself the man he ought to be. The
father&#8217;s comradeship with his boy or girl begins very early
in the child-life, and the earlier it begins, the deeper
and stronger will the roots go down into the soul. Story-telling
during the golden years of childhood in the home,
or as the father walks abroad into the country with his
boy, will weld bonds of friendship between father and
son that no after years can sunder.</p>

<p>Many homes cannot afford a large library of many
books, but no home is so poor that parents in joyous
partnership may not gather the children together on a
winter&#8217;s evening or summer&#8217;s day, and tell them some of
the great stories of the world. To do so is to reenter in
joyous comradeship into the child&#8217;s enjoyment, which is
the highest prerogative of a parent. It is in this sense
&#8220;to become again as a little child.&#8221; And besides all, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
is to be rewarded by discovering, as nearly as can be on
this side of heaven, the fount of perennial youth.</p>


<h4>STORIES IN THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL</h4>

<p>Only recently has the value of teaching by stories
been taken seriously in the Sunday-school. It is likely
Robert Raikes, the founder of the modern Sunday-school
movement, never thought of telling stories to &#8220;the terrible
bad boys,&#8221; the waifs from the alleys of Gloucester,
whom in 1780 he gathered into his first Sunday-school in
that city. Nor did the four teachers whom he hired at
one shilling each week seem to dream of the children&#8217;s
thirst for stories. They were perfectly content to teach
these &#8220;young savages&#8221; to repeat simple prayers, the
Church of England catechism, Bible questions and answers,
and to sing Doctor Watts&#8217; hymns; and occasionally
Robert Raikes gave them a crack on the head with
his walking-stick in order to impress some knotty point
of instruction. But the recent study of child-nature, and
the influence of modern psychology and pedagogy on the
church, have clearly marked out a better way. In the
religious training of children, no less than in their general
education, story-telling is seen to be the easiest,
simplest, and most effective means of impressing upon a
new generation the lessons that have been learned by
those who have gone before.</p>

<p>Dr. H. E. Tralle, in &#8220;Teacher-Training Essentials,&#8221;
says: &#8220;All in all, the story method is probably the most
valuable of all methods of teaching in the Sunday-school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all the things that a teacher should know how
to do,&#8221; says President G. Stanley Hall, &#8220;the most important,
without exception, is to be able to tell a good
story.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>Every Sunday-school teacher who would be successful
in teaching modern boys and girls must give attention
to this golden method of instruction, and should, as early
as possible, learn this &#8220;the easiest of all the creative
arts,&#8221; the delightful art of story-telling.</p>

<p>But oral story-telling has value in the Sunday-school
outside the class instruction. The story form is the best
expression of children&#8217;s worship, and should be employed
in what is called &#8220;the opening and closing exercises.&#8221; A
short story is soon told, but its influence abides long
after &#8220;the address&#8221; is forgotten. Let the story-tellers
and their stories be selected with care, and many a dull
opening or closing exercise will be enlivened and enriched.
Bible stories, Christmas and Thanksgiving
stories, missionary stories, altruistic stories, stories of
hymns, stories of noble acts of children recorded in our
daily papers, all are serviceable. Many of the stories in
this volume have been told again and again in the opening
and closing exercises of Sunday-schools with good results.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Morse Hodge well says: &#8220;If you do not
tell stories at the services of a Sunday-school, please
reflect that some one else may be telling stories to the
same children at some other time and place; may be
doing more to promote their worship of God than what
you may be doing for them by a less intelligent method
of conducting the Sunday-school services.&#8221;</p>


<h4>STORIES IN CHURCH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h4>



<p>&#8220;Stories are better than sermonettes. A five-minute
story, well told, from the pulpit often outweighs an
hour&#8217;s discourse. Children under twelve rarely learn
through abstract terms. Such explanations bore them,
since they are first incomprehensible, and after a story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
are superfluous. Stories are better than object-lessons,
since stories appeal both to the intellect and the emotions.
Suppose a minister holds in his hands a watch and
observes that if it goes wrong it has to be remedied
from the inside, so also if a child goes wrong he has to
be altered in the heart. This is clear so far as it goes, but
it does not instruct a child how to adjust his heart any
more than it teaches him how to be a watch-repairer. But
suppose the minister tells a story of how &#8216;once upon a
time&#8217; a boy failed to be obedient until he fell in love
with his mother. He then deals with the problem
practically, directly, and naturally. The boy is full of
interest, and the minister is religiously educating and
inspiring. Story illustration is essentially the art of
explaining the unknown by the familiar, an untried
experience by an experience already gained, as Jesus used
agricultural parables for peasants and fishing experiences
to unenlightened fishermen.&#8221;</p>

<p>A number of ministers I know are telling five-minute
stories from their pulpits each Sunday morning to the
delight of both young and old; at the same time enriching
their service of worship and solving, as far as it can be
solved under present conditions, the vexed problem of
how to get children to remain to the preaching service of
the church. Others are successful in weaving into their
shortened discourses choice stories which hold attention
and illume and enforce the truth presented.</p>


<h4>STORIES IN THE KINDERGARTEN</h4>

<p>Froebel is the father of the kindergarten and the
great modern inspirer of short story-telling for the young.
His method was to create an atmosphere in which the
child-nature could best bud and blossom in its unfolding
life. For this reason he believed to have the children sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in a circle is far more conducive to good results in story-telling
than the plan of the school with its bench and
book. As disciples of Froebel kindergarteners have been
pioneers in story-telling, leaders and inspirers of others
and, until recently, as a class did more story-telling than
any other educators. The kindergarten age is from three
to six years normally, but with immature children may
continue a year or two longer. In this period the child
is in a transition from nursery rhymes and Mother Goose
jingles to fairy tales, folk-lore, and nature stories. If
the mother is the teacher in the kindergarten of her own
home, as must be the case most generally, let her be sure
to give her children, in addition to Mother Goose jingles,
the Fairy and Folk Tales in Chapters I and III, such as
&#8220;The Runaway Pancake,&#8221; &#8220;Red Ridinghood,&#8221; and many
of the Fables in Chapter II. In the kindergarten proper
let the teacher add to these world stories for this period
such others as these may suggest. And if she has a
creative imagination let her invent new stories from
familiar objects, and let the children have an opportunity
to vote which stories they like best&mdash;the &#8220;made-up&#8221;
ones or these old classics.</p>


<h4>STORIES IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS</h4>

<p>No longer are school-teachers content to have kindergarteners
hold a monopoly of story-telling. Richard T.
Wyche, in his excellent work, &#8220;Some Great Stories and
How to Tell Them,&#8221; says: &#8220;In the grades the child is occupied
largely with reading and writing, the mastering
of form, the book, and the desk&mdash;things that for the moment
deaden rather than inspire, but are means to things
of primary interest to him. So much time is necessarily
put on form and learning to read the story that the pleasure
and inspiration of the story itself is given a secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
place.&#8221; While this is recognized, the oral story, well
told, is finding an ever-widening acceptance in the grades
as the most popular and successful method in education.
Good story-telling is being utilized in many subjects of
the curriculum, for many purposes and in many departments,
within and without the classes, because its artistic
and educational possibilities are so great.</p>

<p>Richard T. Wyche gives his experience as a teacher in
a little school in the South. The teacher who preceded
him &#8220;heard lessons&#8221;&mdash;and the children &#8220;said lessons&#8221;&mdash;an
easy way, he says, &#8220;for the questions were in the
book, and the children could memorize and say the
answers without interest or profit. They were bored by
this mechanical process as was the teacher.&#8221; One day he
told the class the story of &#8220;Hiawatha&#8217;s Fishing,&#8221; and
every child listened with rapt attention, full of interest.
Many of the children wrote out the story for their lessons
the next day. One little fellow who did not write it
told it in such a vivid and realistic way that the class
applauded. Two stories a week followed until the whole
story of Hiawatha was told. All the children were interested,
and within two months, grammar, language, composition,
spelling, drawing, had all been taught by the
story-telling method.</p>

<p>The story is now seen to be so important a method in
education that we may expect to see this art become a
part of the equipment of all teachers, and the story
literature of the world become more and more accessible
and adaptable to the unfolding life of childhood and
youth in our public schools.</p>


<h4>STORIES AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY</h4>

<p>It is a poor public library to-day where there is no
provision for a story-teller and a &#8220;story-hour,&#8221; as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
means of introducing boys and girls to the best books.
Books on the shelves are of no value. They are for
reading, but they are not likely to be read unless they
are known. A story, well told, from a book, will often
prove the most successful way of leading the children to
desire to read the book. A friend of mine, a teacher in
the high school in a small town in Colorado, has influenced
the whole community for good by introducing a
&#8220;children&#8217;s story-hour&#8221; one afternoon a week into a
library which, before her effort, was scarcely patronized
at all, and which now is the center of interest and &#8220;the
liveliest place in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course the primary use of the story-hour in the
library is different from that in other places. In the
public school the purpose of the story is to teach language,
literature, geography, history, and such subjects;
in the Sunday-school, church services, and the home, the
spiritual and ethical aim of the story is necessarily prominent.
In the public library, the story is told for the
purpose of bringing the best books to the attention of
the public that they may thereby be benefited.</p>

<p>As each of these agencies in the educative process of
the child life differs in its task, so it follows that there
must be in each institution a different use of the story.
But as elsewhere, so in the library there are many &#8220;by-products&#8221;
of oral story-telling. Miss Frances J. Olcott, of
the Carnegie Library, Pittsburgh, Pa., the prime mover
and leader in this popular work, calls attention to the by-products
of the story-hour. She says: &#8220;Besides guiding
his reading, a carefully prepared, well-told story enriches
a child&#8217;s imagination, stocks his mind with poetic images
and literary allusions, develops his power of concentration,
helps the unfolding of his ideas of right and wrong,
and develops his sympathetic feelings, all of which &#8216;by-products&#8217;
have a powerful influence on character. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the library hour becomes, if properly utilized, an educational
force as well as a literary guide.&#8221;</p>


<h4>STORIES IN SETTLEMENTS</h4>

<p>Children in settlement districts in our large cities are
not different from other children in their love of stories.
The story-teller is the saint of the settlement. Few settlement
workers to-day would venture on their mission
without the necessary equipment of this art.</p>


<h4>STORIES IN BOYS&#8217; CAMPS</h4>

<p>Stories told to boys around the camp-fire at night
leave little to be desired in a boy&#8217;s imagination. They
charm him as they did the weary hunters in the boyhood
of the race when the story-tellers beguiled the silence
of the desert or forest with the mirth and wonders of
the same tales that delight to-day. One of the finest
collections of stories for boy camps is &#8220;Around the Fire
Stories of Beginnings,&#8221; by Hanford M. Burr.</p>

THE PERIODS OF INTEREST IN STORIES</h3></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a great mistake to suppose that any kind of story
will do for any age of childhood. Nothing could
be more erroneous. There are well-marked periods or
epochs for different kinds of stories, as for any graded
instruction, and care should be taken to give each kind of
story &#8220;in its season&#8221; in the unfolding life. A study of
the normal characteristics and interests of child life
underlies the selection of suitable stories. A boy of
twelve is a very different personality from what he was
at three and seven, and will be at seventeen and twenty-one.
Your boy or girl at twelve will reject, with scorn,
a fairy tale that lights up the wondering eyes of the
young child. It is necessary, therefore, for the parent
or the child-lover to know at just what age a particular
type of story is adaptable, or when the particular ethical
truth intended to be impressed can best be assimilated.</p>

<p>There is perhaps less harm done by giving boys and
girls what is beyond them than is done by talking down
to them. They will be bored by the too mature. They
may permanently scorn the babyish or sentimental.
Moral nuts are not for babes; nor predigested food for
young athletes. Studies of children&#8217;s characteristics and
interests at different periods may be found in such excellent
books as the following: &#8220;Aspects of Child Life
and Education,&#8221; G. Stanley Hall; &#8220;A Study of Child-Nature,&#8221;
Elizabeth Harrison; &#8220;The Pedagogical Bible
School,&#8221; S. B. Haslett; &#8220;The Individual in the Making,&#8221;
Kirkpatrick; &#8220;The Psychology of Thinking,&#8221; Irving E.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Miller; &#8220;The Unfolding of Personality,&#8221; H. T. Mark;
&#8220;Childhood,&#8221; Mrs. Theodore Birney.</p>

<p>Such books are well worth consulting. They should
lead to a first-hand study of the different epochs of child
life by every parent, teacher, and minister who wishes to
be &#8220;a workman who needeth not to be ashamed, rightly
dividing the word of truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roughly sketched, the various periods of child life,
with their story interests, are as follows:</p>


<h4>1. THE PERIOD OF BABYHOOD</h4>

<p>This period is from birth to three years. The story
interest begins with lullabies, rhymes, and jingles. Every
thoughtful mother must notice that even before the little
one can speak it responds to rhymes repeated over and
over. Half of the baby&#8217;s pleasure is in the frequent hearing
of a familiar strain. The baby enjoys also, largely
for rhythm&#8217;s sake, the shortest and simplest stories with
refrains and repetitions; also cumulative stories like the
&#8220;Three Bears,&#8221; &#8220;This Little Pig Went to Market,&#8221;
&#8220;The House that Jack Built,&#8221; and many others to be
found in Mother Goose, Æsop, Grimms, and Jacobs.
Mothers should begin singing and repeating rhymes,
rhythms, and nursery ditties from the child&#8217;s very earliest
days. The child&#8217;s delight in rhyme and rhythm will be
satisfied, the ear will be trained to listen, the power of
concentration will be cultivated, and, best of all, a preparation
for a love of poetry, a most valuable asset in education
and in life, will be begun. A keen interest and
enjoyment in rhythm is found in almost every normal
infant. It is the rudiment or germ of a sense of balance
and harmony, and as such should be carefully nurtured.
The Greeks laid great stress on this sense of harmony
through music and poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<h4>2. THE PERIOD OF EARLY CHILDHOOD</h4>

<p>This period is from three to six years. It begins in
an interest in live things, in domestic animals, and later
in flowers, wind, rain, stars, and other expressions of
nature. The child now finds delight in picture-books,
short stories of animals, birds, and flowers. When a
little older he enjoys fables, short fairy stories, and folk
and wonder-tales, short moral stories and imaginative
stories of home, play, and humor. Historic tales of the
nation and Bible stories, well adapted and simplified in
language, will prove of the greatest interest to children
of this early period. No hard and fast lines can be drawn
in ages. Allowance must always be made for temperament,
disposition, heredity, and family environment. I
have found little children, under three years of age, reproducing
to me, without having previously seen me, or
hearing them from me, several of the fairy stories and
fables in this volume; and I have found boys and girls
nine and ten years old still enjoying them. But with the
average child such short fairy and folk-tales are keenly
enjoyed between the ages of three and six years.</p>


<h4>3. THE PERIOD OF LATER CHILDHOOD</h4>

<p>This period is from six to nine years. It differs from
the preceding period only in the fact that its normal
interests are wider, its vocabulary larger, and its whole
outlook enlarged by reason of attendance upon the public
school. Fairies and Santa Claus are naturally the
favorite characters of children from three to six, but as
they pass out of early childhood they discern that &#8220;the
cow did not jump over the moon,&#8221; and that Santa Claus
is, as one of my little friends expressed it, &#8220;only the
spirit of love.&#8221; The child then wants true stories. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
is apt to inquire earnestly, &#8220;Is it true?&#8221; or his request
may bluntly be, &#8220;Tell me a true story.&#8221; This is the
period for repeating in larger and more descriptive
form the grand old Bible stories that children of this
age love so much. It is the time for the realistic and
historic tales of the nation that kindle imagination and
patriotism. It is the time for the lives of the pioneers,
explorers, or missionaries like Columbus, Capt. John
Smith, Washington, Lincoln, and Livingstone. This is
the golden period of such stories from the Bible (especially
the Old Testament), from general history and from
national history, as are given in this volume.</p>


<h4>4. THE PERIOD OF BOYHOOD AND GIRLHOOD</h4>

<p>This stage, from nine to twelve, is possibly the most impressionable
period of life. It is not a time of marked internal
changes, but one in which the external, social, and
regulative influences are very prominent. Life is unique.
The boy and girl are unlike the children that were, or the
youth and maiden that will be. The transition from
childhood to boyhood and girlhood comes very imperceptibly.
But the average child enters it when he begins
to read easily and naturally; and this ability may well
mark the change. When a boy or girl has this new
power to understand and enjoy books, life acquires a new
range. The whole wide world of literature lies open.
Life begins to be full of meaning. These plastic years
are the habit-forming period. As the twig is bent the
tree will be inclined. A pebble may turn the stream of
life. It is the great memory period. It is the golden
age to mold character after the Pattern in the Gospels, if
the work is done naturally. Give the boy and girl realistic
stories&mdash;those from the Old Testament, and the Gospels,
and Acts; those from the history of all nations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
from our own national life. Give the choicest idealistic
stories&mdash;those legends, strong fables, romances, tales of
chivalry, and poetic interpretations of ethical truth,
such as &#8220;Favorites,&#8221; in Chapter IV of this volume;
Ruskin&#8217;s &#8220;King of the Golden River&#8221;; Hawthorne&#8217;s
&#8220;Great Stone Face&#8221;; and &#8220;The Story of Midas,&#8221; which
so strongly appeal to this age. In this pre-adolescent,
this habit-forming and golden-memory period, imagination,
curiosity, action, impressionableness, trust, loyalty,
and many other instincts of child-nature are all present
ready to combine with every efficient element of environment,
education, example, and experience to build up
the foundation-stones of a wholesome character and useful
life. Feed the minds of these growing boys and
girls on the great Bible stories, the great classic, realistic,
and idealistic stories of the world, such as are found in
this volume, or suggested by them, and your young men
and women will not care for trashy stories as they cross
the bridge of the teens.</p>


<h4>5. THE PERIOD OF EARLY YOUTH</h4>

<p>This period is from twelve or thirteen to seventeen or
eighteen. This adolescent period is the time of marked
changes no less in mind than in body. Like the former
period, it is critical and determinative. Self-consciousness,
memory, honor, heroism, idealism, moodiness,
partisanship, are among the prominent characteristics.
Fairy tales do not interest. Stories of romance, heroism,
and adventure make the strongest appeal. Stories of
egoism, triumph over difficulties, self-mastery, loyalty to
friends, are most keenly enjoyed. Stories of altruism
come later, in the next period. If they have not been
given in the previous period, the great romances of the
world should come early in this stage&mdash;Homer&#8217;s &#8220;Iliad&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and &#8220;Odyssey&#8221;; Virgil&#8217;s &#8220;Æneid&#8221;; the stories of King
Arthur and the Round Table; the stories of &#8220;Beowulf&#8221;
and &#8220;Siegfried&#8221;; the legends of the red Indian &#8220;Hiawatha,&#8221;
and the great romances from the story-books
of the world. The epics, hero tales, romances, and great
purpose-stories of the Old Testament, as well as the
scenes of the New Testament, find a ready response in
every normal youth&#8217;s heart, and should be given at this
period. In addition to these, stories from history, adventure,
modern biography, missionary life, well written
or well told, will interest and impress the character of all
those older boys and girls who are so fortunate as to
have the mirror of life held up to them in this way as
an aid to them in the realization of those highest and
best instincts and impulses which are so naturally and
abundantly surging within their breasts during these
critical early adolescent years.</p>


<h4>6. THE PERIOD OF LATER YOUTH&mdash;YOUNG PEOPLE</h4>

<p>This period is from seventeen to twenty-one or twenty-five.
It is the period of altruism, love, and vocation.
The period of early adolescence is egoistic; this period
is ego-social, and strongly altruistic. This change in
the unfolding nature of youth opens the interest to
stories of self-sacrifice, heroic service and love even for
enemies. These stories could not be appreciated in so
keen a way before. This altruistic interest normally
awakens several years earlier in girls than in boys.
(See Altruistic Stories, page 33.) At the beginning of
this period, and sometimes a little before, a natural interest
in romantic love leads to the keen enjoyment of such
stories. Love is so important and normal a factor in human
life that such interest ought never to be suppressed,
but it should always be directed by the most tactful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
sympathetic guidance in the selection of such love stories
as are referred to on page 33 of this volume.</p>

<p>Another normal interest of this period is that of vocation,
choosing one&#8217;s life-calling. If the young man or
young woman has not already started to work to support
himself, the question of his life-work begins to press hard
for an answer. And the ideals that shall shape the choice
or spirit of that life-work are already being formed.
This is the great time of appeal of such vocational stories
as are indicated on page 34.</p>

TYPES OF STORIES TO TELL</h3></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Stories</span> for telling may be found everywhere&mdash;in a
thousand children&#8217;s books, magazines, periodicals,
poems, novels, histories. They may be recalled from
those heard in childhood. They may be &#8220;made up&#8221;
from the memory of one&#8217;s own past history or the adventures
of friends. Or they can readily be woven out
of a vivid imagination. Such stories may afford children
passing amusement and a degree of profit, but such
stories rarely have the permanent, cultural value that
comes from an acquaintance with the old classics. Emerson
said, &#8220;We love the classics, not because they are
ancient, but because they are true to life.&#8221; Every child
has a right to his literary and esthetic inheritance, and
these classics, these great world stories, should be given
him for their cultural, moral, and religious values before
his twelfth year.</p>

<p>An understanding of the normal interests of child-nature
is the first step in the selection of suitable stories
to tell. The second step is the actual selection. The
selection, of course, will depend on these factors&mdash;the
story-teller&#8217;s purpose, his available material, and his taste.
The purpose of telling a story may be pure enjoyment,
or the impression of an ethical principle, or some cultural
or educational aim. The available material may be supplied
by many books of short stories retold. Such is the
purpose of the present volume. The taste of the story-teller
must not be permitted to dominate the real life
interests and needs of the child&#8217;s nature. Nor will this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
be the case if we realize the child&#8217;s story interests, and
permit the child to vote on the kinds of stories he likes.
An understanding of the different types of stories to tell
will be of value to all who desire to secure the best
results. Some of the different types of stories may be
classified as follows:</p>


<h4>1. BIBLE STORIES</h4>

<p>Bible stories are the best of all to tell to children. They
have a cultural, esthetic, literary, educational, and ethical
value, quite apart from their spiritual and religious use,
that puts them in the very front rank as stories that interest,
instruct, and inspire young life. These stories are
the rich inheritance of the race. They are a treasure-house
of ethical and spiritual wisdom. Bible stories are
never sectarian. It is the teller&#8217;s fault if he so interprets
them. They are pervaded by a perennial humanity and
a direct simplicity that make the strongest appeal to the
young of every century. The Bible reaches into the soul
and impels the will to action as no other book does. For
these reasons every child should be made familiar with
the Bible from babyhood up. Simple parts should be
read aloud to the child in its early years. The simplicity,
dignity, and grandeur of the language, the objective
spirit, and the dramatic action bring many parts of the
Bible within the comprehension of even a very young
child. In telling such adapted forms as are reproduced
in this volume, care should be taken, as early as possible,
to familiarize the child with the Bible version itself.
Some of the best collections of Bible stories are: &#8220;Children&#8217;s
Treasury of Bible Stories,&#8221; Mrs. Herman Gaskoin;
&#8220;Tell Me a True Story,&#8221; Mary Stewart; &#8220;Stories About
Jesus,&#8221; Dr. and Mrs. C. R. Blackall; &#8220;Story of the
Bible,&#8221; J. L. Hulburt; &#8220;Story of the Bible,&#8221; C. Foster;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
&#8220;Kindergarten Bible Stories,&#8221; Cragin; &#8220;Old Stories of
the East,&#8221; James Baldwin.</p>


<h4>2. MISSIONARY STORIES</h4>

<p>Numerous short and simple stories of heroic lives have
recently been written in a very attractive way for boys
and girls. These hero stories are for telling, not reading,
in home, Sunday-school classes and opening exercises,
junior mission circles, or young people&#8217;s missionary
meetings. A few of the best are: &#8220;Fifty Missionary
Heroes Every Boy and Girl Should Know,&#8221; by Julia H.
Johnson; &#8220;Love Stories of Great Missionaries,&#8221; by Belle
M. Brain; &#8220;The White Man at Work,&#8221; and &#8220;The
Splendid Quest,&#8221; by Matthews (suitable for children
eight to fifteen).</p>


<h4>3. PLAY STORIES</h4>

<p>Some parents and teachers find it hard to see any value
in play stories like &#8220;The Runaway Pancake,&#8221; &#8220;The Little
Red Hen,&#8221; and &#8220;The Golden Goose&#8221; (pages 47-51);
or such nonsense stories as &#8220;The Fox Without a Tail,&#8221;
&#8220;Why the Bear Has a Stumpy Tail&#8221; (pages 71, 77); or
funny stories like &#8220;Lazy Jack&#8221; and &#8220;Epaminondas.&#8221;
Such parents do not get the child&#8217;s point of view. The
idle pleasure or extravagance provokes their displeasure
and appears to them driveling nonsense. But why should
not the mind have an innocent frolic? Why should the
child be deprived of his birthright of &#8220;being a child&#8221;
and &#8220;understanding as a child&#8221;? The child loves play
and loves these play stories because they are play.</p>


<h4>4. FAIRY AND FOLK-TALES</h4>

<p>Sometimes a mother says: &#8220;I do not want to tell my
child lies. I will give him only truth, history, biography,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
or useful stories.&#8221; Such a mother fails to see that in
excluding fairy and folk-tales from her child&#8217;s mind she is
simply shutting the door of his imagination and hindering
his power to do great things in after-life by closing for
him the storehouse of creative imagination. Imagination
is the most powerful factor in any life. Helen Keller,
when asked what sense she considered the most important,
replied, &#8220;Imagination!&#8221; By imagination the
blind see the invisible. By this sense, Newton, Kepler,
Davy, Faraday, Edison, and Burbank saw from afar
their great discoveries and inventions and brought them
near. Such an unpoetic mother would rob her child of
his right to his inheritance of an age-long literature; a
literature marking his kinship with the race-children of
the past; a literature adapted to his needs as to theirs,
and a literature which will serve as the basis of all true
spiritual culture. &#8220;There are those who reduce life to
the plane of that of Dickens&#8217; Thomas Gradgrind, who
cared not for feeling and sentiment, but must have cold,
bare, hard facts, enjoying only the practical and the
usable, and living in his rectangular house and having
everything about him right-angled. But we know that
in children there is a place for the sentimental and the
free play of feeling, although these are not to be made
prominent in training and instruction but provided for
in the material used. Doctor Parker said: &#8216;The atheism,
the materialism of the present day in our land, is largely
due to the banishment of fiction and fairy tales by the
Puritans. &#8220;Facts,&#8221; Gradgrind &#8220;facts,&#8221; drive beauty and
holiness from the child&#8217;s heart.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Fancy, imagination, power to see the unseen, need to
be fed with suitable food. Imaginative stories exercise
and cultivate the imagination, the creative faculty. If a
child lacks imagination, fairy stories help to arouse it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
If he knows little about nature, tales of woods and fields
will quicken and interest. Children who are brought up
in cities especially need the counteracting influences
breathed by these race-long tales which are so imaginative,
objective, and childlike, and which have been the
joy of childhood from the morning of the world. The
best fairy tales also have great ethical value. They
present moral truths in a way that appeals directly to
children. &#8220;Cinderella&#8221; teaches the reward of modesty
and humility; the &#8220;Golden Goose&#8221; shows the reward of
charity and a kind heart; &#8220;Red Ridinghood&#8221; illustrates
obedience to parents, the cardinal virtue of childhood;
&#8220;Boots and His Brothers,&#8221; readiness; &#8220;Toads and
Diamonds,&#8221; good and bad speech; and &#8220;The Frog
King,&#8221; keeping a promise. Fairy tales that present perverted
ideas of right and wrong or that picture success
achieved by lying or theft, or that justify ingratitude,
disloyalty, or irreverence, should find no place in collections
for children. Yet, in the desire to impress a moral
lesson, great care must be taken not to strip these age-long
stories of all their native freshness and strength.
The best moral effect will be gained by letting the child
enjoy the story as a whole without too pronounced
emphasis on the moral. Some good collections are:
Grimm&#8217;s &#8220;Household Tales&#8221;; Andersen&#8217;s &#8220;Wonder
Stories&#8221;; Grimm Brothers and Joseph Jacobs, &#8220;Fairy
Tales&#8221;; Baldwin, &#8220;Fairy Stories and Fables.&#8221;</p>


<h4>5. FABLES</h4>

<p>Fables are short stories in which animals or inanimate
objects are represented as speaking or acting with human
interests or passions. They were among the earliest
stories told by all races. Many of the commonest fables,
earliest told to children to-day, such as the &#8220;Dog in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the Manger&#8221; and &#8220;The Boy Who Cried Wolf,&#8221; originated
in Asia. Æsop&#8217;s &#8220;Fables&#8221; was the first moral
lesson book for children. They are now an integral part
of our literature and language. For this reason, as well
as others, children should become familiar with them.
They please the child&#8217;s fancy, satisfy his craving for
short, objective, ethical tales, and impress such virtues
as prudence, honesty, contentment, generosity, and wisdom.
Fables that teach revenge or success by lying and
craft should be rejected.</p>

<p>Some good collections are: Æsop; La Fontaine;
&#8220;Fables and Folk Stories,&#8221; H. E. Scudder; &#8220;Fairy
Stories and Fables,&#8221; Baldwin.</p>


<h4>6. MYTHS</h4>

<p>Myths have their origin in primitive man&#8217;s personification
of the forces and objects of nature, as gods,
demons, giants, dwarfs, light-elves, spirits of darkness,
trolls, and hideous monsters. Interpreting nature in
poetic imagery and language, primitive races came to
believe in these myths as their religion. The Greek
myths, which are largely personifications of the beauty
of nature, are especially pleasing to children who love
stories of flowers, trees, fountains, and sudden transformations,
as the natural response to their inherent love of
nature. The Norse myths are personifications of the
awe-inspiring natural phenomena of the cold and rugged
northland. Such stories picture stalwart courage, manliness,
and heroic virtue, qualities that appeal to later
childhood and youth. The myths of the American Indian,
such as Longfellow&#8217;s &#8220;Hiawatha,&#8221; treating of the
spirit of the wild woods and free out-of-door life, are
well adapted to the child&#8217;s love of nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Myth is not a goal. It is a means by which the goal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
is reached. The race grew out of the myth-making
period of its development, and the child will grow out of
the myth-loving stage in its religious development, unless
hindered by parents or teachers who unwisely withhold
this childhood religious material from him.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Some of the best collections of myths are Hawthorne&#8217;s
&#8220;Wonder-Tales&#8221;; Kingsley&#8217;s &#8220;Greek Heroes&#8221;; &#8220;Norse
Stories Retold,&#8221; Mabie; &#8220;Stories of the Red Children,&#8221;
Dorothy Brooks.</p>


<h4>7. LEGENDS</h4>

<p>Both myths and legends belong to folk-lore literature
and to the idealistic type of story. The difference between
them is that the myth is a personification of nature,
while the legend is an idealization of a person or place.
&#8220;The myth is a creation of fancy from ideas. The
legend is the perception of an idea from a basis in fact.
The myth is a creation of pure and absolute imagination.
The legend is a story based on historical fact, but enlarged,
abridged, or modified at pleasure. Both myths
and legends express the imagination, emotion, and spirit
of early man, and, for this reason, make a strong appeal
to the same qualities in the soul of those who are in the
early years of life to-day.&#8221; As all races have their
legends, the list of them is long. Not one-thousandth
part of them can be told. Among legends that age after
age has loved and treasured, are those of India, brought
together in the &#8220;Jataka Tales,&#8221; those of Greece and
Rome, of the Middle Ages, of the Northmen, of King
Arthur and the Round Table, and of the American Indian.
Some of the best collections are: &#8220;Juventus
Mundi,&#8221; Gladstone; &#8220;Famous Legends,&#8221; Crommelin
(legends of all countries); &#8220;Legends of Greece and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Rome,&#8221; Kupper; &#8220;Book of Legends,&#8221; Scudder; &#8220;Child&#8217;s
Book of Saints,&#8221; Canton.</p>


<h4>8. NATURE STORIES</h4>

<p>Stories of animals, birds, pets, trees, plants, flowers,
mountains, seas, and other expressions of nature are
very popular with children from their earliest years. But
these stories need adaptation and strengthening with the
growing years. They may be used to teach the habits of
animals or the laws of plant life, thus stimulating scientific
interest in the animal and plant world. Their best
use is simply to please and delight the child&#8217;s fancy.
How children revel in a story that begins, &#8220;Once there
was a bear,&#8221; or &#8220;There was once a little, furry rabbit.&#8221;
Such stories are the first steps, in curiosity and imagination,
into the feelings and fortunes of creatures different
from themselves, preparing for a sympathetic interest
in the lives of others, not only of animals, but of human
beings. In the early years, fanciful animal stories may
be given. But later, only true stories of animals have
value. Some good nature stories are: &#8220;Nature Myths
and Stories,&#8221; Cooke; &#8220;True Tales of Birds and Beasts,&#8221;
Jordan; &#8220;Door-yard Stories,&#8221; Pierson; &#8220;True Bird
Stories,&#8221; Miller.</p>


<h4>9. ALLEGORICAL STORIES</h4>

<p>The allegory is a double story, or two stories in one.
While one story is being told, another, a deeper and
often a still more interesting story, is caught by the
imagination or reason. Fables and parables are short
allegories with one definite moral. The allegory has been
the favorite form of story among almost all nations, and
is especially pleasing to children. The Bible contains a
number of beautiful allegories, one being the comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of Israel to a vine, in the Eighteenth Psalm. Æsop&#8217;s
fable of the stomach and its members is an allegory.
Some of the most perfect allegories are found in &#8220;The
Golden Windows,&#8221; and &#8220;The Silver Crown,&#8221; by Laura
E. Richards. Ruskin&#8217;s &#8220;King of the Golden River&#8221;;
Spenser&#8217;s &#8220;Faerie Queene&#8221;; Swift&#8217;s &#8220;Tale of a Tub&#8221;;
Addison&#8217;s &#8220;Vision of Mirza&#8221;; Mrs. Gatty&#8217;s &#8220;Parables
from Nature&#8221;; Miss Slossum&#8217;s &#8220;Story-Tell-Lib&#8221;; and,
above all, Bunyan&#8217;s &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress,&#8221; are allegories
with which every modern boy and girl should become
familiar.</p>


<h4>10. HISTORICAL STORIES</h4>

<p>Idealistic stories&mdash;fairy tales, folk-lore, myths, legends,
fables, and allegories&mdash;have their place. They add to the
poetry, imagery, enjoyment, spirituality, and enrichment
of a life that would often be wholly prosaic without them.
But after all, the growing boy and girl who pleads
&#8220;Tell me a true story,&#8221; at approximately the age of six,
reveals the truth that the mind cannot be satisfied without
the solid, hard, real ground of historical and scientific
fact. For this reason by far the larger number of
stories that must be told, and that are demanded by advancing
childhood and youth, are realistic stories. These
are stories from national or world history, biography,
personal reminiscences and adventures, true stories of
animals, and all others that recount actual happenings.
&#8220;These have a special value because, besides suggesting
a principle, they also indicate how it may receive specific
application in life. The deeds of the Christian martyrs
and of the modest heroes of every-day life have a certain
power which is beyond that of the most beautiful myth.
The story of what Jesus did means more than all the
visions of all the prophets.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Stories of national history impress the mind of the
young with patriotism. Historical world stories inspire
the heart of the young with a broader human sympathy
for all the nations of the earth. The hunger for the
heroic, which is native to the imagination and emotion
of every growing boy and girl, may be fed by these
classic stories of heroic action, endurance, decision, courage,
faith, and self-sacrifice.</p>


<h4>11. BIOGRAPHICAL STORIES</h4>

<p>&#8220;God writes his greatest thoughts in noble men and
heroic women.&#8221; The Bible is a book of biographies.
The Gospels are the four biographies of its preeminent
character, Jesus. This is one reason for the great charm
of the Bible stories and for the great value of the Bible
as a never-failing source from whence to gather material
for the unfolding mind of childhood and youth.</p>

<p>History too is largely the story of great lives in their
setting. The stories of individuals, and of events in
which they are concerned, furnish the best historical
material for boys and girls from nine to twelve. Indeed,
biography should be central in the study of history
at least to the sixteenth year. Suitable stories of the
lives of great men and women are interesting at all
stages of life, but particularly during the years of later
childhood and early adolescence, when environment is
widening and social and world interests are expanding.
Biography is full of religious nourishment, spiritual contagion,
ethical uplift, and humanitarian values. That
which makes the strongest appeal is found in the Old
and New Testaments, the life of Christ, the Acts of the
Apostles, the great lives in national and general history,
lives of discoverers, pioneers, missionaries, adventurers,
inventors, warriors, seamen, and characters full of deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of daring and difficulty, but at the same time manly and
moral. Biography has too often, in the past, been limited
to a record of the heroic deeds of generals and statesmen
in war and political upheavals. We now see more
clearly the value, in the earlier period of education, of
biographies of leaders in other fields besides war and
statesmanship, and we realize the necessity of inspiring
youth with lofty ideals, by examples of both men and
women in all possible forms of human service and moral
and social heroism. This truer interpretation of the
ethical and spiritual value of biography and history is
illustrated by the biographical stories in Chapter X,
&#8220;Heroes of Peace,&#8221; and Chapter XI, &#8220;Modern Boys
and Girls Who Became Useful.&#8221;</p>


<h4>12. ALTRUISTIC STORIES</h4>

<p>Stories of unselfish heroism appeal to every age, but
they find their strongest interest for the spirit of youth
during the years of middle adolescence. Such stories of
self-sacrifice may be selected from the Bible, history, fiction,
or modern life. They not only show what is noble
action, but touch the soul with the contagion of self-sacrificing
deeds. From the Ethical Index, on page 291,
under Altruism, Loyalty, Self-sacrifice, and such synonyms,
a list of altruistic stories may be made.</p>


<h4>13. LOVE STORIES</h4>

<p>Stories of real or romantic love between the sexes have
their strong appeal in middle adolescence. There may
be an interest in these before this period or it may appear
later. Such stories are usually for reading, but some of
the best for telling are: &#8220;Ruth, the Gleaner&#8221;; &#8220;John
Alden and Priscilla&#8221;; &#8220;Evangeline&#8221;; &#8220;The Silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Girl&#8221;; &#8220;Love Stories of Great Missionaries,&#8221; by Belle
M. Brain; &#8220;The Three Weavers,&#8221; by Annie Fellows
Johnson.</p>


<h4>14. VOCATIONAL STORIES</h4>

<p>These are the stories that will aid in preparing young
people in choosing their life-work, or that will inspire
them with the highest ideals in their work. Such stories
may be found among all types. For example, the fairy
story, &#8220;Boots and His Brothers,&#8221; shows the value of
being prepared; the Bible story, &#8220;When Jesus Was
Lost,&#8221; shows when Jesus found his life-work; &#8220;The
Legend of St. Christopher&#8221; reveals ideals of service,
and such legendary or historical stories as &#8220;Horatius at
the Bridge,&#8221; &#8220;King Bruce and the Spider,&#8221; and &#8220;Dick
Whittington&#8221; illustrate the rewards of service. Biographies
are almost all vocational. This vocational interest,
either clearly revealed or simply implied, may
transform a story, otherwise distasteful to young people,
into one full of interest, inspiration, and profit.</p>


<h4>15. INSTRUCTIONAL STORIES</h4>

<p>These are stories that are invented simply for the
purpose of imparting instruction in some branch of science
or art. The story-form and story-interest is taken
advantage of to produce interest in the desired trade,
craft, occupation, or science. Such stories must be used
with care. But if used moderately and with tact they
may prove of educational and even vocational value.</p>


<h4>16. HUMOROUS STORIES</h4>

<p>Variety is of great importance in story-telling, as in
all ethical instruction and educational training. Life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
demands variety. Moral life is full of variety, vitality, and
humor. Nor need we fear to bring these qualities into
story-telling. Humor is leaven. Without it ethical teaching
becomes flat. Laughter too is good for the world.
It is a tonic to the emotions. &#8220;It does us all good to
laugh if there is no smear or smirch in the laugh; fun
sets the blood flowing more freely in the veins, and
loosens the strained cords of feeling and thought; the
delicious shock of surprise at every &#8216;funny spot&#8217; is a
kind of electric treatment for the nerves.&#8221; (Sara Cone
Bryant.) Laughter is tone to the spirit and inspiration
to fresh effort. It is a sign too, of broadening imagination
and sympathies. As the nonsense and play-story are
good for the child, so the wholesomely humorous story is
good for the youth and the adult.</p>

PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR STORY-TELLING</h3></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> true story-teller, like the true poet, is born, and
not made. Talent in this creative art is a gift of
nature, like a beautiful voice or skill in painting. But
study, cultivation, and practice are necessary to advance
the story-teller in his art, as in the case of the singer or
the painter. Some practical suggestions may prove of
value to beginners in story-telling:</p>


<h4>1. ENCOURAGEMENT</h4>

<p>There is comfort in knowing that a story need not be
perfectly told to interest and delight little children in the
home, kindergarten, or the lower grades of the Sunday-school
and public school. The imagination of the little
child is so keen, so abundant, and flows so freely that
it triumphs over external defects of presentation and
reaches the heart of things. Though this is true of one
child or of a small group of children of about the same
age and interests, it is not true, as practice soon teaches,
of a large group, especially of children of different interests.
Such an audience needs the magnetism of personality
to hold it, and some real art in the presentation
of the movement and details of the story.</p>

<p>Such professional story-telling is a rare gift, and is as
valuable as it is rare. Not every parent, teacher, minister,
or educator of youth, who may wish to be a story-teller
may have the skill, time, patience, or perseverance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to become an artist. Such training would involve the
study of the technique of the use of the voice and of
gesture, a thorough knowledge of the sources for stories,
skill in the selection and preparation of material, practice
in actual story-telling, and the hearing of stories told by
professionals, the character of whose work unconsciously
becomes the ideal of the story-teller. Training for such
professional story-telling is given in colleges, presented
in a number of interesting books, and encouraged by
story-tellers&#8217; training classes and leagues in many places.
The hints here offered have the more modest story-teller
in mind, the busy parent in the home, and the
Sunday-school or public-school teacher, who may not
have access to the technical books on the art of story-telling.</p>


<h4>2. TELL THE STORY</h4>

<p>Tell, do not read, the story. The teller is free. The
reader is fettered. The oral story is more spontaneous,
the connection with the audience is closer, the effect is
more magnetic. It is the story plus personality and appreciation.
The story-teller can give his message with
his eyes as well as his lips without book or memory of
the printed page to burden. The world stories contained
in this volume are all designed for telling. After reading
them through carefully once or twice, the mind will
have the facts ready for telling. Stories adapted for
telling must be written with more dramatic action and
movement than those adapted for reading. But stories
that are in a form suitable for telling are well adapted
for enjoyable reading. Hence these stories have a
double value, for telling or reading. But let it be kept
well in mind that telling a story is incomparably better
than reading it to any listener. The charm of a book
cannot equal the magnetism of personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>


<h4>3. SELECT THE STORY</h4>

<p>Select your story with some definite purpose in mind&mdash;pure
enjoyment or some definite ethical principle, and
let the aim be clearly in mind in the preparation for
telling it. Select your story also with the child&#8217;s story-interests
in mind, as presented in Chapter II. Make sure
also that it is suitable in length and in style. Children
who are accustomed to hearing stories can listen a longer
time than those whose ears and brains are quite untrained.
With very young children five minutes gives
room for a really stirring tale.</p>


<h4>4. MAKE THE STORY YOUR OWN</h4>

<p>This is not the task of the memory, but of the imagination
and the feelings. Read and reread the story. Do
not memorize it. Visualize it. Picture it mentally. Fall
in love with it. See the images. Feel the emotions of
the characters. Breathe the atmosphere. Absorb its
spirit, scene, setting, plot, people, and parts. Make it
your own creation, living anew in your own soul. Then
lay the book aside, and at leisure reproduce it, part by
part, in your own thought or words, making sure that you
have well in mind the story&#8217;s four parts: (1) Beginning;
(2) progress of events; (3) climax; (4) end.</p>


<h4>5. MASTER THE FOUR PARTS OF YOUR STORY</h4>

<p>(1) Your story must have a beginning, which should
be brief, concrete, interesting, introducing the chief character,
scene, atmosphere, or spirit of the story in the
fewest possible words.</p>

<p>(2) Your story must have a progress of events, an
orderly movement, giving the essential facts, step by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
step, and full of action, leading up to the climax without
revealing it in advance.</p>

<p>(3) Your story must have a climax that cannot be
missed. This is the point and pith of your story. It is
that for which it is mainly told and enjoyed. If a moral
lesson is to be imparted, it is here that it is enforced.
And failure here is total failure. Make sure of this
climax, for to miss it is like trying to tell a joke, missing
the point, and meeting humiliation and defeat.</p>

<p>(4) Your story must have an end. A successful ending
is quite as important as the climax, and needs careful
consideration. It must be brief and appropriate, and
leave the mind at rest, without any questioning or dissatisfaction.
It may be well for the beginner at first to
analyze his stories in this way, into these four parts,
either in his thoughts or on paper, for it will give excellent
practice and make the retention of the story by the
memory a simple matter. But with practice and drill
these four parts of a good story will take their place in
the mind and in the telling most naturally, easily, and
pleasantly.</p>


<h4>6. INTRODUCING YOUR STORY</h4>

<p>The consciousness of having a good story to tell, and
a story adapted to the age and interests of one&#8217;s audience,
is the first step to that ease, freedom, dignity, and
repose which are necessary at the start. If the story-teller
can select his time, as many parents and teachers
can, so much the better. If he is met by an ill-prepared
audience, or an audience in an uncomfortable place,
or under adverse circumstances, his introduction must
serve to put him in touch with his audience. If several
stories are in mind, the order may be changed, and a
&#8220;humorous&#8221; story or other introductory remarks may
serve to pave the way for the necessary response. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
he may proceed with the intended story or stories with
his own eye and heart kindled, moving in a straightforward,
spontaneous, self-forgetful way toward the desired
lesson in the climax, and ending happily, leaving the
audience delighted and impressed.</p>


<h4>7. RETELL YOUR STORIES</h4>

<p>Practise your stories! &#8220;Repetition is the mother of
stories well told.&#8221; Repeat them. Do not be afraid of
retelling them. The younger the children are the better
they like old friends. Every one loves a &#8220;twice-told
tale.&#8221; (Hervey.) &#8220;Practise! It will go clumsily at
first. Imagination will be dull, facts will escape your
memory, parts will be confused. But persevere, persevere!
Study results. Listen to others. Catch their
points of effectiveness. Above all things practise! practise!
practise!&#8221; (Wells.)</p>


<h4>8. LET CHILDREN REPRODUCE YOUR STORIES</h4>

<p>Children should be given an opportunity to tell and
retell the stories heard. Children like to create, and
whether it be with sand, wood, or words, the underlying
processes are the same. For a child to retell a story
means that he enters into the spirit of it, that he sees
clearly the mental picture, that he feels the atmosphere
and life of the story. In this way imagination, memory,
language, and reason are enriched and, at the same time,
the ethical principle of the story is more clearly impressed
on the child&#8217;s mind, to be assimilated at pleasure.</p>

GAMES WITH STORIES</h3></div>


<h4>FINGER STORIES</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Froebel</span> was the first educator to discover the educational
value of simple, instructive mother-plays. His
&#8220;Mother Play Book&#8221; is one of the greatest books in the
whole history of education. In it Froebel pictures home
as it ought to be, and accompanies the mother in her
daily round through the house, garden, field, worship,
market, and church. Here is one of his charming set of
finger games for the mother to teach her child while
he is yet in her arms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">This is the mother, good and dear;</div>
<div class="verse">This is the father, with hearty cheer;</div>
<div class="verse">This is the brother, stout and tall;</div>
<div class="verse">This is the sister, who plays with her doll;</div>
<div class="verse">And this is the baby, the pet of all.</div>
<div class="verse">Behold the good family, great and small!</div>
</div></div>

<p>In such a song, the dawning consciousness of the child
is turned to the family relations, and is surely an improvement
on the old nursery method of playing &#8220;This little
pig went to market.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are also little story finger-plays in which gestures
may be employed as in the finger-play rhymes.
A collection of these finger stories, the first play stories
for infants, is given in &#8220;Descriptive Stories for All the
Year,&#8221; by M. Burnham; and in &#8220;Finger Plays,&#8221; by Emilie
Poulsson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>


<h4>PLAYING THE STORIES</h4>

<p>In early childhood, as soon as a story takes possession
of the child, he shows a tendency to enter into its persons
and its action; to mimic the voices, to ape the manners,
to imitate the acts. This is the instinct of imitation and
play. The child should be allowed to play out the story
in this way, or better still, the parent or teacher may
propose playing the story. Not every story may be
played equally well, but the following familiar child&#8217;s
stories may be used in play and heartily enjoyed without
staging or any stage terms&mdash;just natural, spontaneous,
hearty play: &#8220;Little Red Ridinghood,&#8221; &#8220;The Fox and
the Grapes,&#8221; &#8220;The Lion and the Mouse,&#8221; &#8220;The Hare
and the Tortoise,&#8221; &#8220;Dick Whittington and His Cat,&#8221;
&#8220;Androcles and the Lion,&#8221; and others in this book.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Fox and the Grapes&#8221; (page 67) may be played
by a single child. A wall is selected for holding the
imaginary bunches of grapes. The child stands or
crouches, looking up longingly at them, then jumps up
for them, and, finally, after a fall, walks or crawls away,
saying, &#8220;I know those grapes are sour and not worth
eating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lion and the Mouse&#8221; (page 74) may be played
by two children. One child, choosing to be a lion, lies
flat on the floor taking a nap. The child acting as a
mouse crawls over him, awakening the lion, who roars
and pins the mouse to the earth with his paw. &#8220;Let me
go! I&#8217;ll help you some time,&#8221; cries the mouse, and, being
freed, runs away. Later the lion is in an imaginary net,
the meshes of which the mouse gnaws, and then runs
away, saying, &#8220;I did help you after all, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a similar way many of the stories of this book may
be reproduced in play by two or more children to their
great enjoyment and instruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>


<h4>DRAMATIZATION OF STORIES</h4>

<p>As in the day-school kindergartens, little children play
stories in response to a natural impulse to act out whatever
they are thinking about, so in Sunday-school primary
classes simple stories may sometimes be played with
great pleasure and profit. In a school in Chicago the
teacher had told the story of the &#8220;Lost Sheep.&#8221; Later
the children played the story. They made the fold of
chairs. One child was the shepherd, another child was
the wandering sheep, and all the other children were the
sheep who followed the shepherd safely back to the fold.
When the shepherd realized that one sheep was missing,
he started out to hunt for it. He looked behind great
rocks (chairs) and in all dangerous places until he
found the lost sheep. Certainly the child who took the
part of the little lost sheep will not forget. In such a
simple way the beginner in both the day-school and the
Sunday-school, or in the home, may act out a story
whose lesson will never be effaced from memory.</p>

<p>In later grades, historical and even Bible stories may
be dramatized in short plays with excellent results. On
special days, instead of presenting a ready-made cantata,
let the children give a little play of their own composition,
the result of several weeks of work upon a suitable
Bible story.</p>

<p>Two good books of special interest on this whole subject
are: &#8220;Historical Plays of Colonial Days,&#8221; by L. E.
Tucker and Estelle L. Ryan; &#8220;Quaint Old Stories to
Read and Act,&#8221; Marion F. Lansing.</p>

USE OF THE ETHICAL INDEX</h3></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Frequently</span> a parent in the home, a teacher in
the schoolroom, a minister, or other child-helper, in
dealing with children, wishes to find a suitable story, at
a moment&#8217;s notice, that may aptly and forcibly illustrate
some ethical principle that he may wish to inculcate.
Often a story, well selected and aptly told, will hold up
&#8220;the mirror to nature&#8221; and, indirectly, by the law of
suggestion, impress the mind and heart of the child far
more successfully than a precept, command, or obtrusive
moral. The Ethical Index, which will be found at the
end of this book, on page 291, is for this purpose. By a
moment&#8217;s reflection upon the moral principle desired to
be impressed or suggested, a story illustrating it may be
found. Of course, in many stories more than one ethical
principle may be found, but no more than one, and that
the strongest and most evident lesson, should be emphasized
in one story. In this ethical use of a story great care
must be taken not to overemphasize the moral lesson
embedded in it, for that will be to lose it. In the use of
this index the story-teller may well remember the prayer
of Henry Van Dyke, &#8220;May I never tag a moral to a tale
or tell a story without a meaning.&#8221;</p>

FAIRY AND WONDER TALES</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Adapted for Children, Three to Six Years.</i>)</p>


<h4>1. THE RUNAWAY PANCAKE</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time seven hungry children were standing
around the fireside, watching their mother frying
a pancake for supper. &#8220;Oh, give me a bit, mother
dear, I&#8217;m so hungry,&#8221; each of the children said. &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
said the mother, &#8220;only wait till it turns, and you shall
have some.&#8221; Pancake trembled and tried to jump out of
the pan, but its back was so weak that it fell flat again
on the other side. When that side was cooked, and its
back felt stronger, Pancake gave a spring, jumping right
out of the pan upon the floor, and began rolling away
like a wheel, out through the door and down the steep
hill. &#8220;Stop! Stop! Pancake!&#8221; cried the mother, running
after it with the frying-pan in one hand and the spoon
in the other. &#8220;Stop! won&#8217;t you stop?&#8221; all the children
screamed; but Pancake rolled on faster and faster down
the hill. It was a funny sight to see a man, and a hen, and
a rooster, and a duck, and a goose, and a gander, all
joining in the chase, trying to catch Pancake, who slipped
by them all and rolled on. At the bottom of the hill
there was a deep river. Just as Pancake rolled near it a
Pig came up and said, &#8220;Pancake, roll on my snout, and
I&#8217;ll take you safely across.&#8221; &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Pancake,
rolling right upon Piggy&#8217;s nose. He sat there till they
reached the other side in safety. &#8220;Ouf! Ouf!&#8221; then
grunted the Pig; &#8220;what will you pay me for carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
you across?&#8221; When Pancake said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything
to pay you,&#8221; the Pig threw back his head, opened his
mouth wide, and down went Pancake, saying, &#8220;I wish
I had been eaten by those poor, hungry children, rather
than by this nasty Pig!&#8221; And that was the end of
Runaway Pancake.</p>


<h4>2. THE LITTLE RED HEN</h4>

<p>Once there was a Little Red Hen that lived, so neat
and tidy, all alone in her house in the wood. Over the
hill and far away in a den in the rocks lived a bad young
Fox. He wanted to eat the Little Red Hen, but every
time he went to her home he could not get her. One
morning he took a big bag and told his mother to have
the pot boiling when he got home so they could cook the
Hen for supper that night. Over the hill he crept, trot,
trot, trot, and saw Little Red Hen picking up sticks in
front of her house. The Fox quietly slipped in without
being seen, and hid behind the door. The Little Red Hen
came in with her apron full of sticks, but when she saw
the Fox with his bushy tail spread out on the floor, she
became so scared she flew with a great scream to a high
beam under the roof. The tricky Fox began to whirl
around and around after his tail so fast that the Hen
got so dizzy she fell to the floor. Quickly the Fox
picked her up, popped her into his bag, and trotted off
for home. Coming to a hill he thought he would stop,
to take a rest, and he put his bag on the ground. Quick
as a wink the Hen pecked a hole in the bag, jumped out,
rolled a stone into the bag in her place, flew away to her
home, and locked the door. &#8220;The Little Red Hen is
heavy,&#8221; said the Fox as he started off again. As soon
as he saw his mother, he cried, &#8220;Here is the Hen for
our supper. Lift the cover off the pot, while I pop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
her in.&#8221; When the mother lifted the cover, the young
Fox untied the bag and gave it a shake. Pop! Splash!
Splash! Into the boiling water dropped the heavy stone.
Out flew the boiling water, splashing and scalding the
young Fox and his mother to death. So the Little Red
Hen lived happily and tidily in her house after that.</p>


<h4>3. THE GOLDEN GOOSE</h4>

<p>Once a mother lived with her three sons in a house in
the woods. One day the mother said to the oldest son,
&#8220;Go, and cut wood in the forest, and here is a good
dinner for you.&#8221; At dinnertime a queer, little old man
came up and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m so hungry. Give me some of
your dinner.&#8221; &#8220;Be off,&#8221; said the selfish boy, and he ate
all his dinner by himself. Then he began to chop down a
tree, but his axe slipped and cut his leg, and he went
hobbling home without any wood. Next day the mother
said to the next boy, &#8220;Go, and cut wood in the forest,
and here is a good dinner for you.&#8221; At dinnertime the
same queer little old man came and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m so
hungry. Give me some of your dinner.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said the
selfish boy, who ate all his dinner by himself. Then he
began to chop a tree, but his axe slipped and cut his
foot, and he went hobbling home without any wood. The
next morning the youngest boy, Dummling, said,
&#8220;Mother, I&#8217;ll get you some wood.&#8221; His mother gave
him only some dry crusts, and he went into the woods.
The same little old man came, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m so hungry.
Give me some of your dinner.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, gladly, I will,&#8221;
said Dummling. In a moment the little old man changed
the dry bread into a rich feast, and they both ate as
much as they wanted. Then the little old man said:
&#8220;You have been kind to me. Now I will do something
for you. Cut down this tree, and at the roots you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
find a Golden Goose.&#8221; Dummling quickly chopped down
the tree, and in a hollow at the roots found a Golden
Goose. He picked it up and went to the nearest stopping-place
for the night, where he found three sisters who
wanted some of the golden feathers. So, when Dummling
had gone to bed, the oldest girl went in where the goose
was to pluck a feather, but she stuck fast. The second
girl came in later to pluck a feather, and she stuck fast
too. Then the third sister, greedy for a feather too, put
in her hand to get one, and she stuck fast. So the three
girls had to stay with the goose all night. The next
morning Dummling came in, and, not noticing the girls
were stuck fast to it, picked up the goose and started off
with it under his arm. The three girls were obliged to
follow as fast as their legs could carry them down the
street. A minister seeing the strange sight called out,
&#8220;Shame! following a man like that! Let go!&#8221; But as
soon as he touched them he stuck fast and had to follow.
Then a policeman ran up, saying to the minister, &#8220;For
shame! following girls like that! Let go!&#8221; And as soon
as he touched them he stuck fast and had to follow. It
was a funny sight to see these five trudging behind one
another. &#8220;Help! Help!&#8221; cried the policeman. Then two
men going to work with picks and spades ran up, but as
soon as they touched them they stuck fast and had to follow.
So these seven, all in line, treading on one another&#8217;s
heels, followed Dummling and his Golden Goose until
they reached the gates of the city in which a King lived
who had a daughter so very serious that no one could
ever make her laugh. The King had promised that whoever
could make her smile should have her for a wife,
and should be the King&#8217;s son. When Dummling heard
that he went at once near the palace window, and when
the Princess looked out and saw such a comical sight she
burst into a hearty laugh. So Dummling became the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
King&#8217;s son, and lived with the Princess and his Golden
Goose, happy ever afterward.</p>


<h4>4. DIAMONDS AND TOADS</h4>

<p>Once there was a mother who lived with her two
daughters in a house in the woods. The elder daughter
was very proud and disagreeable; the younger one was
kind, sweet-tempered, and beautiful. The mother was
very fond of the elder daughter because she was more
like herself, and she disliked the younger one and made
her work hard all the time in the kitchen and go twice
a day to carry water in a pitcher from the spring in the
woods two miles from home.</p>

<p>One day, when this younger daughter was at the
spring, a poor old woman came to her and asked her for
a drink. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the kind, obliging girl, and she
gave her a cool, refreshing drink from her pitcher. The
woman said: &#8220;As you have been kind to me, I will give
you this gift. At every word you speak a jewel or a
flower shall come from your mouth.&#8221; When she reached
home her mother scolded her for being gone so long.
&#8220;I beg your pardon, mother dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for not
being quicker.&#8221; And as she spoke, out of her mouth
dropped two diamonds, two pearls, and six roses.
&#8220;What do I see?&#8221; exclaimed her mother. When the girl
told her all, the mother said: &#8220;I must send my dearest
daughter to receive this gift too. Come, Fanny, see what
comes out of your sister&#8217;s mouth when she speaks. All
you have to do to get the same gift is to go and give the
poor old woman a drink from the pitcher.&#8221; &#8220;I won&#8217;t
go,&#8221; said the ugly-tempered girl; &#8220;let sister give me
some of her jewels. She does not need them all.&#8221; At
last her mother persuaded her to go, and she went
grumbling all the way. When she reached the spring she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
saw, not the poor old woman her sister had met, but a
beautiful lady, who asked her for a drink. It was the
fairy changed from the old woman into a princess. &#8220;I
did not come out to give <i>you</i> a drink,&#8221; said the selfish
girl; &#8220;you can get water from the spring as well as I.&#8221;
&#8220;You are not very polite,&#8221; said the fairy; &#8220;since you are
so rude and unkind I give you this gift: At every word
you speak, toads and snakes shall come out of your
mouth.&#8221; The girl ran home, and as soon as she spoke
to her mother two snakes and two frogs fell from her
mouth. &#8220;What is this I see?&#8221; cried her mother. The
girl tried to tell, but at every word toads and snakes
dropped from her lips. And so it was forever after&mdash;jewels
and flowers fell from the kind girl&#8217;s mouth, but
only toads and snakes fell from the mouth of the girl
who was rude and unkind.&mdash;<i>Charles Perrault.</i></p>


<h4>5. THE FROG KING</h4>

<p>Once there was a king who had a little daughter so
beautiful that the sun had never seen any one so beautiful.
Close by the palace there was a dark wood, and underneath
a large tree was a well. One day the little Princess
sat by this well, tossing her golden ball into the air until
at last it fell into the water. She began to cry bitterly.
A Frog peeped out of the water and said, &#8220;What will
you give me, King&#8217;s Little Daughter, if I get your ball
for you?&#8221; &#8220;I will give you anything,&#8221; she said, &#8220;my
pearls, my jewels, my golden crown.&#8221; &#8220;If you will let
me be your playmate and sit by your side at table,
and eat out of your golden plate, and sleep in your
little snow-white bed, I will bring your ball to you
again.&#8221; &#8220;I promise all,&#8221; she said, thinking that a Frog
could not live with people. In a moment the Frog
plunged into the water head foremost, caught the ball, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
swam back with it in his mouth and threw it on the
grass to her. She picked up her pretty plaything and
ran away with it, heedless of the Frog&#8217;s cry, &#8220;Wait!
Wait!&#8221; She did not listen, but ran home as fast as she
could and forgot all about her promise to the Frog.</p>

<p>The next day as the royal family was seated at dinner,
something came creeping, splish, splash, splish, splash,
up the marble staircase. Then a knock was heard at the
door, and a voice said, &#8220;King&#8217;s Little Daughter, open the
door for me.&#8221; When she opened the door she saw the
Frog. She screamed with fright, and slammed the door
in his face. When she told her father of her promise to
let the Frog be her playmate, the King said, &#8220;What you
have promised you must keep. Go, and let him in!&#8221;
She opened the door and the Frog hopped in and followed
her step by step to the chair. &#8220;Lift me up!&#8221; he cried.
She did not like to do this, but the King said, &#8220;What
you have promised you must keep.&#8221; When the Frog
was on the chair, he wanted to be on the table and eat
out of the golden plate, and when she started to go upstairs
he asked her to let him rest on her snow-white bed.
She was afraid of the cold, clammy Frog, and she began
to cry again. But the King said, &#8220;What you have
promised you must keep. Ugly though he is, did he not
help you when you were in distress, and will you despise
him now?&#8221; So the Princess took hold of him with her
fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner.
When he pleaded again to rest on her snow-white bed,
she became angry and took hold of him and threw him
with all her might against the wall. &#8220;Now will you be
quiet, hateful Frog?&#8221; she said. But when he fell to the
floor suddenly he changed from a frog into a beautiful
Prince with kind and shining eyes looking at her. He
told her how he had been changed into a Frog by a very
wicked fairy, and how no one but she could get him out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of the well and change him into a King&#8217;s son again, and
that when they grew older they would be married and
live together in his kingdom. The next morning when
the sun was up, a carriage appeared drawn by eight white
horses, and when the King and Queen gave their consent
for the Princess to go, she was glad to be the Queen
and live in the Prince&#8217;s beautiful kingdom. But she
never forgot what her father had told her, &#8220;What you
have promised you must keep.&#8221;</p>


<h4>6. RED RIDINGHOOD</h4>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_054f.jpg" alt="GOOD MORNING, LITTLE GIRL, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;GOOD MORNING, LITTLE GIRL, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?&#8221;</p>

<p>Once a sweet little girl, named Red Ridinghood, lived
with her mother in a house near a wood, and her loving
Grandmother lived on the other side of the wood. One
day her mother said, &#8220;Take Grandmother this basket of
fresh eggs, butter, and cakes, for she is ill. Be sure and
not leave the main path.&#8221; The little girl said, &#8220;Yes,
mother, I will do just what you say.&#8221; Then she took the
basket and went skipping and singing happily through
the wood, until she saw some beautiful flowers a little
distance from the path. &#8220;I will gather just a bunch of
these lovely flowers for Grandmother,&#8221; she said to herself;
but she had not gone far when she met a big, gray
Wolf, who said, &#8220;Good morning, little girl, where are
you going?&#8221; &#8220;To my Grandmother&#8217;s,&#8221; she said. Then
the Wolf ran on before and knocked at Grandmother&#8217;s
door with his paw, &#8220;Thump! Thump!&#8221; Grandmother
was better and had gone out for a walk. So the Wolf
walked in, put on Grandmother&#8217;s nightcap, and jumped
into her bed. Soon Red Ridinghood came up and knocked
at the door. &#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; said a voice, trying to
speak like Grandmother. &#8220;It is your little girl,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Come in, dear,&#8221; said the voice. When she
entered and looked in the bed, she cried out, &#8220;O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Grandmother, what big ears you have!&#8221; &#8220;The better
to hear you, dear.&#8221; &#8220;What big eyes you have!&#8221; &#8220;The
better to see you, dear.&#8221; &#8220;What big arms you have!&#8221;
&#8220;The better to hug you, dear.&#8221; &#8220;What big teeth you
have, Grandmother!&#8221; &#8220;The better to eat you!&#8221; cried
the Wolf, springing up. He was just about to eat her
when the door burst open and in rushed some wood-choppers
who soon killed the big, gray Wolf. Red Ridinghood
ran home to her mother as fast as she could, and
said, &#8220;Oh, mother dear! it happened because I disobeyed
you, and went in that horrid path where I met the Wolf.
But I will never, never disobey again!&#8221;</p>




<h4>7. GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE BEARS</h4>

<p>Three bears lived in a home of their own in the woods&mdash;one,
a great, big Bear, the Father, with a great, big
voice; a middle-sized Bear, the Mother, with a middle-sized
voice; and Little Baby Bear, with a little, wee voice.
One morning, when the three bears were taking a walk
while waiting for their breakfast of milk and honey to
cool, a naughty, disobedient, runaway girl, named Goldilocks,
came along and peeped into their window. Seeing
no one, she walked into the kitchen and began to taste
the breakfast. Father Bear&#8217;s was too hot; Mother Bear&#8217;s
was too cold; Baby Bear&#8217;s was just right, so she ate it
all up. Then she went into the parlor to rest, and saw
three chairs. Father Bear&#8217;s was too hard; Mother Bear&#8217;s
was too soft; Baby Bear&#8217;s was just right, so she sat on
it and broke it down. Then Goldilocks went up the narrow
stairs to the bears&#8217; bedroom. She climbed on Father
Bear&#8217;s bed, but that was too high for her; the Mother&#8217;s
was too low; but the Baby Bear&#8217;s bed was just right, so
she fell fast asleep. Soon the three hungry bears came
home. Father Bear roared, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Some one has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
tasting my breakfast and sitting on my chair!</span>&#8221;
Mother Bear growled out: &#8220;<i>Some one has been tasting
my breakfast and sitting on my chair!</i>&#8221; Baby Bear
screamed, &#8220;Some one has been tasting my breakfast and
eaten it all up, and sitting in my chair and broken it
down!&#8221; The bears then rushed upstairs. &#8220;<span class="smcap">Some one
has been on my bed!</span>&#8221; roared Father Bear. &#8220;<i>Some one
has been on my bed too!</i>&#8221; growled Mother Bear. &#8220;Some
one has been in my bed, and here she is!&#8221; screamed Baby
Bear. This awoke Goldilocks, who was so frightened
she sprang out on the other side of the bed, jumped out
of the window, and ran home as fast as she could.</p>


<h4>8. THE SLEEPING BEAUTY<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h4>

<p>Once a good King and Queen were so happy to have a
little baby girl that they gave a great feast in the palace,
to which they invited seven beautiful Fairies, each of
whom brought her a rich present. But one ugly Fairy,
named Jealousy, who was angry because she was not
invited, said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make the Princess cut her hand with a
spindle, and she shall die!&#8221; Everybody began to cry,
but one good Fairy said: &#8220;No, she shall not die, but she
shall sleep for a hundred years, and can be awakened only
by a good Prince.&#8221; The King ordered all spindles to be put
away; but when the Princess was sixteen years of age an
old woman, who had not heard of the King&#8217;s command to
put away all spindles, let the young Princess spin. In a
moment she had cut her hand and fell to the ground in
a deep sleep. The good Fairy flew at once to her side
and said: &#8220;She is not dead, but, as I said, she shall sleep
a hundred years, and can be awakened only by a good
Prince.&#8221; They carried the sleeping Princess home, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
when the Fairy thought how lonely she would be on
awaking in a hundred years, she touched with her wand
all the maids and servants, even Mopsy, her pet dog, and
all fell asleep and were left in the great room in the
palace with the Sleeping Princess, who lay there dressed
in her most beautiful, royal garments. The King and
Queen died of grief soon after, and great trees grew up
around the palace, hiding it from the world, until a hundred
years passed away. One day a Prince, rich, handsome,
and good, was hunting in this thick forest, when
suddenly he saw the palace towers, and asked an officer
what the building was. When the officer told him how
the good Fairy had said a Sleeping Princess in the
palace could be awakened only by a good Prince, he
determined to try and awaken her. Quickly entering the
strange palace he found the beautiful Princess, fair as
wax, sleeping on her couch, dressed in her royal garments,
which were very beautiful though so strange and
old in style. There too were the maids and servants in
their queer clothes, and Mopsy, the pet dog, sleeping at
the side of the Princess. The King&#8217;s son quickly touched
one of the fair hands of the Sleeping Beauty and stooped
to kiss it, and in an instant the Princess opened her eyes
wide and smiled at him. At the same moment all the
maids and servants, and even Mopsy, awoke and looked
as fresh as though they had been asleep only a night.
The servants at once, helped by the good Fairy, prepared
a rich wedding-feast in the great dining-hall. Then the
good Prince took the beautiful Princess to his own palace,
where they were married in great joy. The palace in the
woods disappeared. The ugly old Fairy, Jealousy, had
died years before, but the good Fairy, whose name was
Patience, came often to visit the good Prince and his
Beautiful Princess, who had awaked from her sleep of
one hundred years.</p>

<h4>9. JACK AND THE BEAN-STALK</h4>

<p>Once a poor widow lived alone with her boy, Jack, who
was careless and paid no attention to what his mother
said. One day Jack saw her in tears, for, she said, &#8220;We
have nothing now in the world but a cow, which we
must sell to get food.&#8221; So next morning, taking the cow
to market, Jack met a butcher who showed him some
wonderful beans, which he offered to give for the cow.
Jack gave him the cow for the beans, and ran home very
happy, thinking his mother would be happy too over
his good fortune. But his mother was so grieved that
she threw the beans out of the window, and both of them
went supperless to bed that night. Next morning, lo!
the beans had grown so tall that the stalks made a ladder
reaching far up into the sky. Unseen by his mother,
Jack began climbing up, up, up, until he reached the top,
where he saw a strange country, and in the distance a
great house. This was the castle of a great Giant who
had gone on a journey. The Giant&#8217;s wife received Jack
kindly, giving him something to eat, and when the Giant
came home she hid him in the oven. Through a crack
Jack peeped and saw the Giant eat his supper and then
place a wonderful hen on the table, and every time he
said &#8220;Lay,&#8221; she laid a golden egg. When the Giant fell
asleep Jack jumped out of the oven, picked up the hen,
ran off with it, and climbed down the bean-stalk. He
found his mother crying, but when Jack put the wonderful
hen on the table and said &#8220;Lay,&#8221; his mother&#8217;s eyes
grew big with surprise, and her tears dried at once.
Soon they had as many golden eggs as they wished to
live on. But one day a fox ran off with the golden
hen. Again, unseen by his mother, Jack climbed the
bean-stalk. This time the wife hid him in the lumber
closet when the Giant came roaring home. Through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
crack Jack peeped and saw the Giant eat his supper and
then place on the table big bags of gold and silver, and
play with them. When the Giant fell asleep, Jack jumped
from the closet, picked up the bags of money, ran off
with them, climbed down the bean-stalk like lightning,
and ran home. He found his mother again in tears, but
when Jack showed her the bags of gold her surprise made
her smile again. Not long after that, again unseen by
his mother, Jack climbed up the bean-stalk. This time
the wife hid him in a large kettle when the Giant came
roaring home. Lifting up the lid a little way, Jack peeped
out and saw the Giant eat his supper and then take out
a magic harp and began to play wonderful music. When
he fell asleep Jack jumped out of the kettle, picked up
the magic harp, and started off with it. But the magic
harp called out &#8220;Master! Master!&#8221; so loudly that the
Giant awoke and began running after Jack. But Jack
reached the top of the bean-stalk first. He climbed down
it like lightning, picked up his axe, and chopped down
the bean-stalk at its roots, making it fall over just as the
Giant began to climb down. In a moment the wicked old
Giant fell down into the garden, with a loud noise like a
falling tree. And that was the end of the Giant and the
Bean-stalk. But Jack never again caused his mother any
sorrow.</p>


<h4>10. JACK, THE GIANT-KILLER</h4>

<p>Once a poor farmer had a good son named Jack, who
was wide-awake and always ready to help. Far up on
the mountain in a great cave lived a wicked Giant named
Carmoran, who was so fierce and frightful that everybody
was afraid of him. Every time he wanted food he came
down the mountain to the valley and carried off oxen on
his back, and pigs and sheep tied around his waist. The
people were in despair. One day Jack heard the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
officers say: &#8220;All the treasure the Giant has hidden in his
cave shall be given to whoever rids the land of this evil
Giant!&#8221; Jack laughed and said to them, &#8220;I will try!&#8221;
So he took his horn and pick-axe and shovel and began
digging a pit, deep and broad, covering it with sticks and
straw. Then he sprinkled earth over it until the place
looked like solid ground. Then he stood on the other
side of the pit, and just at the peep of day he
put his horn to his mouth and blew, &#8220;Tan-tivy!
Tan-tivy!&#8221; The old Giant awoke, rubbed his eyes and
rushed out of his cave, and seeing Jack running away,
cried, &#8220;You villain, I&#8217;ll pay you for troubling my sleep!
I&#8217;ll boil you for breakfast!&#8221; Just as he said that down
he fell into the pit, and the very foundations of the mountains
trembled at his fall. &#8220;O Giant,&#8221; laughed Jack,
&#8220;will no other food suit you than sweet Jack?&#8221; Jack
was not long in killing the wicked old Giant in the pit.
Then he went to the cave and brought out all the treasure.
When the town officers heard of this good deed
Jack, the farmer&#8217;s son, had done, they called him</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jack, the Giant-killer</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>They gave him a sword and belt, and in the belt they
wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<h4>11. ALADDIN AND HIS WONDERFUL LAMP</h4>

<p>Once there was a Chinese boy named Aladdin, who
was playing in the street, when a strange-looking man
called to him, &#8220;My boy, I am your uncle! Come with
me! I will give you great riches!&#8221; He took out of
his pocket a beautiful gold ring, which he gave to the
boy, who walked away with him. After a long time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
came to a great stone which had a ring to lift it up.
The man lifted up the stone and showed Aladdin a deep
cave, saying to him: &#8220;At the other end of this cave there
is a door leading to a palace and a garden of fruit trees
where you will find a lamp hanging. Bring me this lamp
and I will give you great riches.&#8221; This man was not
Aladdin&#8217;s uncle, but a wicked magician, who wanted to
use the boy to get this lamp for him, for it had power to
make whoever possessed it greater than any prince.
Aladdin went down into the cave and found the lamp and
everything just as the man had said. When he came back
to the mouth of the cave he said, &#8220;Uncle, help me up!&#8221;
&#8220;Give me the lamp first,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;No,&#8221; said
Aladdin, &#8220;I won&#8217;t give it to you until you help me out.&#8221;
That made the magician very angry. So, uttering some
magic words, he slammed the stone down over the mouth
of the cave, and poor Aladdin was shut up alone in darkness.
The disappointed boy sat a long time thinking what
to do. But suddenly when he happened to rub the ring
that the magician had put on his finger and forgotten, in an
instant the Slave of the Ring, a queer, little old man, stood
before him saying he was ready to do for him whatever
he asked. &#8220;Then take me out of this cave,&#8221; said Aladdin,
and instantly he was out. He ran home and showed his
mother the lamp. &#8220;I will polish it, mother,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and then we can sell it for much money.&#8221; No sooner
had he rubbed it than the Slave of the Lamp, a great
strong Giant, stood before him, saying that he was ready
to do for him whatever he asked. &#8220;Then, bring us plenty
to eat,&#8221; said Aladdin, and instantly richest food on golden
plates stood before him. Every time he rubbed the lamp
the Slave of the Lamp came and gave him everything he
asked. One day, when he became older, he fell in love
with a beautiful Princess, and he asked his mother to
take several golden vases full of rich jewels as a present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to the King and beg him to let the Princess become his
wife. The King laughed at such an idea, but said: &#8220;If
your son will send me forty golden vases like these, full
of the richest jewels, he shall have the Princess.&#8221; Aladdin
quickly rubbed his lamp and asked the Slave of the
Lamp to bring him forty golden vases filled with richer
jewels than the former ones. The King was so delighted
with them that he gave Aladdin the Princess to be his
wife, and Aladdin asked the Slave of the Lamp for a
grander palace to live in than the King&#8217;s. They lived
very happily until one day, when Aladdin was away
hunting, a strange-looking man came near the palace
calling out, &#8220;Lamps! Lamps! Who will change old
lamps for new ones?&#8221; A servant ran to her mistress
and said, &#8220;Shall I exchange this ugly old lamp I found
in the cupboard for a new one?&#8221; Without waiting for
an answer she took it and sold it to the old pedler, who
was really the wicked magician in disguise. So he got
the lamp after all. Quickly he rubbed it, and when the
Slave of the Lamp appeared, he said, &#8220;Transport Aladdin&#8217;s
palace and all in it to Africa.&#8221; Instantly the palace
was gone. When Aladdin returned from hunting, the
King ordered the poor fellow&#8217;s head to be cut off at once,
but Aladdin plead for forty days to find out where his
palace and Princess had gone. Then he remembered his
gold ring. This he quickly rubbed and asked the Slave
of the Ring to transport him to his palace. Instantly
Aladdin was transported to Africa, and stood in his
palace before his Princess, who was in tears because of
the wicked magician. Soon after that the Slave of the
Ring helped him to get back his wonderful lamp by
killing the wicked magician. Then the Slave of the Lamp
transported him back to his home with his palace and the
beautiful Princess. But Aladdin never again lost his
wonderful lamp.</p>

<h4>12. BOOTS AND HIS BROTHERS</h4>

<p>Once there were three brothers, Peter, Paul, and John.
Their father was very poor. One day, being unable to
keep them longer, he told them they must go out into the
world to earn their own living. Not far from their home
lived a King, in front of whose palace-windows a great
oak grew, with branches and leaves so thick that the
light was shut out of the palace. The King had promised
a great fortune to any one who would cut the oak down.
Many tried, but the strange thing was, for every chip
cut off two new chips took its place, so that the tree grew
larger, rather than smaller, and the palace grew darker.
The King had promised also to give his daughter and
half his kingdom to any one who would dig a well so
that he could get pure water for his palace. Many had
tried to do this, but the rocks only grew bigger for all
their digging and shoveling. When the three brothers
heard of this, each said, &#8220;I will help the King and get
the fortune, the King&#8217;s daughter and half the kingdom.&#8221;
They started off in great expectation, but they had not
gone far into the fir woods on the side of a steep hill,
until they heard some one hewing and hacking farther up
the hill in the wood. &#8220;Now, I wonder what that is?&#8221;
said Jack. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a woodchopper, of course,&#8221; the
two brothers answered; &#8220;you are always wondering about
something!&#8221; &#8220;Still, I&#8217;d like to see,&#8221; said Jack, and up
the hill he went while his brothers sauntered on. Jack
soon saw a strange sight&mdash;an axe hacking and hewing
away all by itself at the root of a great fir tree. &#8220;Good
morning,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;So you stay here all alone and
hew, do you?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the axe, &#8220;and here I&#8217;ve
hewed and hacked a long, long time waiting for you!&#8221;
&#8220;Well, here I am at last,&#8221; said Jack, and he put the axe
into his bag. When he climbed down the hill and joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
his brothers they laughed at him and said, &#8220;Well, what
did you see?&#8221; &#8220;The axe that we heard,&#8221; Jack answered,
but he said nothing more. Farther on they came to a
great ridge of rock which ran up the mountainside, and
far off they heard something digging and shoveling.
&#8220;Now, I wonder what that is?&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a
woodpecker, of course,&#8221; answered the brothers; &#8220;you are
so clever with your wonderings!&#8221; &#8220;Still, I&#8217;d like to see,&#8221;
said Jack, and up the rock he climbed while his brothers
sauntered slowly on. At the top of the rock he saw a
strange sight&mdash;a spade digging and digging away all by
itself. &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;So you stay here
all by yourself and dig, do you?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the spade,
&#8220;and here I&#8217;ve been digging a long, long time waiting
for you.&#8221; &#8220;Well, here I am at last,&#8221; said Jack, and he
placed the spade in his bag, and returned to join his
brothers, who laughed and said, &#8220;Well, what did you
see?&#8221; &#8220;The spade that we heard,&#8221; said Jack. So they
went along until they came to a brook at which each
drank, and then Jack said, &#8220;I wonder now, where this
water comes from?&#8221; &#8220;Why, water rises from a spring
in the earth,&#8221; laughed the brothers. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a great mind
to see where this brook starts from,&#8221; said Jack, starting
to climb up. At the tiny source of the brook Jack found
a walnut, out of which the water trickled. The walnut
said, &#8220;I have trickled and trickled here many a long day,
waiting for you.&#8221; &#8220;Well, here I am at last,&#8221; said Jack,
as he filled the little hole in the walnut with moss and
placed it carefully in the bottom of his bag and ran down
to meet his brothers again. &#8220;Well, have you found out
where the water comes from?&#8221; they said. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said
Jack, &#8220;out of a hole up there.&#8221; So they kept making
fun of him, until at last they reached the King&#8217;s palace.
They found the oak bigger and the rock harder than
ever, because so many had tried in vain. The King, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
discouragement and despair, had said, &#8220;Whoever tries
and fails now shall have both his ears cut off, and he shall
be placed on a desert island.&#8221; The three brothers were
not afraid. First Peter, and then Paul, tried to chop
down the oak and fill the well with water, but instead of
the fortune, they got both their ears cut off, and they
were sent off to a desert island. Then Jack was ready
to try. &#8220;If you want to look like a sheared sheep with
your two ears cut off, we&#8217;re ready for you,&#8221; said the
King&#8217;s servants, really feeling sorry for the young man.
But Jack took out the axe and said, &#8220;Hew! Hew!&#8221; and
soon the great oak fell with a crash and great light shone
in the palace. Then he took out the spade and said,
&#8220;Dig! Dig!&#8221; and soon the rock broke in two and the well
was deeper. Then he pulled out the walnut, took away
the moss from the hole, and put the walnut in the well,
and the water trickled, trickled so fast that very soon
pure water filled the well. So Jack had felled the oak
which darkened the palace, removed the rock, and filled
the well in the palace-garden with water. Then the King
gave him the great fortune, his daughter&#8217;s hand in marriage
and one-half his kingdom, as he had promised.
And the axe, and the spade, and the walnut said: &#8220;Those
who have ears and will not use them must not complain
if they are removed; and are we to blame if we help only
those who are ready to use us?&#8221;</p>

FABLES</h3></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Adapted for Children, Three to Nine Years.</i>)</p>


<h4>1. THE BOY AND THE NUTS</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> day a selfish Boy saw a jar of nuts. He put his
hand into the jar and grasped as many as his hand could
hold. As the mouth of the jar was small he could not
pull his hand out, so he became frightened and began
to cry. &#8220;I can&#8217;t get my hand out!&#8221; he whined. A boy
standing near said, &#8220;Take only half as many, and you
can easily get your hand out!&#8221;</p>


<h4>2. THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS</h4>

<p>Once there was a man who had a wonderful Goose
that laid for him every day a fine golden egg. But the
man wanted to get all the golden eggs at once. So he
killed the Goose and cut her open, but found she was
like all other geese. So he lost the Goose he had because
he was so greedy and impatient.</p>


<h4>3. THE DOG IN THE MANGER</h4>

<p>Once a hungry Cow came to a manger full of hay.
But a Dog was lying there, snarling and barking, and
would not let the Cow come near the hay. &#8220;Mr. Dog,&#8221;
mooed the Cow, &#8220;How selfish you are; you cannot eat
the hay yourself, and you will let no one else have any
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<h4>4. THE TOADSTOOL AND THE ACORN</h4>

<p>In a forest a Toadstool once sprang up in a night.
Early the next morning, as soon as the first passer-by
touched it with his foot, the Toadstool fell to the earth
and its life was ended. A little Acorn grew and grew
and grew during more than one hundred years, and it is
still standing strong and tall in the forest.</p>


<h4>5. THE BOYS AND THE FROGS</h4>

<p>One day some boys at play were throwing stones into
a pond at some frogs. At last one old Frog peeped up
out of the water and said, &#8220;Boys, why are you so
cruel?&#8221; &#8220;We are only playing!&#8221; shouted the boys. The
old Frog croaked back: &#8220;It may be fun for you, but
remember it is death to us. Do to us as you would like
us to do to you.&#8221;</p>


<h4>6. THE DOVE AND THE ANT</h4>

<p>Once a little Ant went down to the river to drink. He
fell into the water and began to drown. Just then a
Dove, perched on a tree, saw him and quickly dropped
down a leaf, which served as a little boat on which the
Ant sailed safely to the shore. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the
Ant as he shook his wet feet, &#8220;I shall not forget this.&#8221;
Next day a Hunter was aiming his bow and arrow
straight at the Dove when the Ant bit his foot, making
the man jump, and the Dove flew away.</p>


<h4>7. THE FOX AND THE GRAPES</h4>

<p>A Fox who was hungry saw some large, juicy grapes
on a vine high up in a tree. &#8220;How good they will
taste,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I am going to have some of them.&#8221;
Then he gave a run and leaped as high as he could, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the grapes were still far above his head. He could not
reach them no matter how high he jumped. At last he
trotted off in a rage, muttering, &#8220;I know those are
sour grapes and not worth eating.&#8221;</p>


<h4>8. THE CROW AND THE PITCHER</h4>

<p>Once a Crow who was very thirsty found a pitcher
with a little water at the bottom which he was unable
to reach. He tried to overturn the pitcher but it was too
heavy. &#8220;Ah! Ah! I know what I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; he said. So
he gathered up pebbles from the ground, and one after
another dropped them into the pitcher until the water
gradually reached the top. Then the wise Crow was
able to drink all the water he wanted.</p>


<h4>9. THE WIND AND THE SUN</h4>

<p>One morning the Wind said to the Sun, &#8220;I am
stronger than you are.&#8221; The Sun said, &#8220;I know I am
stronger than you are.&#8221; As they were quarreling over
the question a traveler came in sight. So they agreed
to decide the matter by seeing which first could make him
take off his coat. Then the Wind began blowing, blowing
as fiercely as he could. He nearly tore off the
traveler&#8217;s coat, but the man buttoned his coat up more
closely about him, and the Wind had to give up, beaten.
Then the Sun, clearing away the clouds, shot his hottest
beams down on the traveler&#8217;s back, and the man soon
threw off his coat. Then the Sun said, &#8220;Wind, you make
more noise, but, you see, I am stronger.&#8221;</p>


<h4>10. THE SHEPHERD BOY AND THE WOLF</h4>

<p>Once there was a boy who took care of a flock of
sheep near a town. One day, when some men were working
in the town, they heard the boy call, &#8220;Wolf! Wolf!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
The wolves are among the lambs!&#8221; The men ran up to
him in great haste, but found no wolf among the lambs
at all. The boy had a good laugh, and said, &#8220;I only
called you for a joke!&#8221; He did the same thing two or
three times. At last the wolves really came and began
carrying off the lambs. The boy cried, &#8220;Wolf! Wolf!
The wolves are carrying away the lambs!&#8221; But the men
said, &#8220;He can&#8217;t fool us again!&#8221; So they would not
come, and the wolves carried off many of the lambs.
The foolish boy lost his place and found out, when too
late, that a boy who tells lies, even in fun, may not be
believed when he tells the truth.</p>


<h4>11. THE LION AND THE FOX</h4>

<p>Once an old Lion was sitting at the door of his den
when a Rabbit came near. &#8220;Good morning, Bunny,&#8221;
said the Lion, &#8220;come in and see my nice den.&#8221; &#8220;Thank
you,&#8221; said Bun, and went in, but he did not come out
again. Soon a Dog came by. &#8220;Come in, friend Doggie,&#8221;
said the Lion. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the Dog, and he went
in, but he did not come out again. By and by a Fox
came along. &#8220;Good morning, Mr. Fox,&#8221; said the Lion,
&#8220;come in and see me.&#8221; &#8220;No, thank you, sir,&#8221; said the
Fox, &#8220;I see the footprints of a Rabbit and a Dog going
in, but I see no footprints pointing out.&#8221;</p>


<h4>12. THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE</h4>

<p>One day a Hare stood laughing at the slow pace of the
Tortoise, and boasting how swiftly he could run. The
Tortoise laughed back cheerfully, &#8220;Let us race five
miles, and let Mr. Fox be the judge, and decide who
beats.&#8221; So they got ready, and when the Fox said
&#8220;One, two, three, go!&#8221; off they started. The slow-going
Tortoise, jogging along, was soon left far behind by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
swift-speeding Hare, who laughed at the fun and said,
&#8220;I might as well take a nap!&#8221; When the Hare awoke
he looked up and saw the Tortoise almost at the goal.
Running like the wind he reached the goal a few minutes
too late. &#8220;Oh, oh, my friend,&#8221; laughed Judge Fox,
&#8220;slow and steady wins the race.&#8221;</p>


<h4>13. ONE GOOD TRICK</h4>

<p>Once a Cat and a Fox met in the wood. The Fox
said: &#8220;I know a hundred different tricks for getting away
from hunters&#8217; dogs. How many do you know, Puss?&#8221;
&#8220;I know only one,&#8221; said Puss, &#8220;and if that fails me
I am a dead cat!&#8221; &#8220;Poor, poor Pussy,&#8221; sighed the Fox,
&#8220;I am sorry for you!&#8221; Just then the cries of hunters
and barking of dogs were heard. The Fox ran off as
fast as he could, trying this trick and that, but the hunters&#8217;
dogs soon caught him. The Cat simply sprang up to the
top of a tree. That was her one trick, and she was safe.
&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Puss, as she saw the Fox carried off, &#8220;one
good trick is better than a thousand poor ones.&#8221;</p>


<h4>14. THE CONCEITED GRASSHOPPER</h4>

<p>One day a very young Grasshopper and an old Rooster
met out in a field. &#8220;I can jump higher than anybody,&#8221;
chirped the Grasshopper. &#8220;All right; let me see you
do it,&#8221; said the Rooster, at the same time opening his
mouth wide as if he meant to yawn. &#8220;Here I go, then,&#8221;
cried the Grasshopper. He jumped so high he landed
right in the mouth of the Rooster, who gulped him down.
That was the end of the boasting Grasshopper.</p>


<h4>15. THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT</h4>

<p>Six blind beggars sitting by a roadside as an Elephant
passed were told that they might touch it so that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
would know what an Elephant was like. The first one
touched only the Elephant&#8217;s side and said, &#8220;He is like a
wall!&#8221; The second one felt only his tusk and said,
&#8220;No, no, he is like a spear.&#8221; The third took hold of his
trunk and said, &#8220;He is surely like a snake.&#8221; &#8220;No such
thing,&#8221; cried the fourth, grasping one of his legs, &#8220;he is
like a tree.&#8221; The fifth was a tall man and took hold of
his ear, and said, &#8220;All of you are wrong, he is like a
big fan.&#8221; The sixth man happened to catch hold of his
tail, and cried, &#8220;O foolish fellows, he is not like a wall,
nor a spear, nor a snake, nor a tree, nor a fan; he is
exactly like a rope.&#8221; So the Elephant passed on while the
six blind men stood there quarreling, each being sure he
knew exactly how the Elephant looked, and each calling
the others hard names because the rest did not agree with
him.</p>

HUNGRY TO BED IN WINTER" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;THOSE WHO PLAY AND DANCE ALL SUMMER MUST EXPECT TO DANCE
HUNGRY TO BED IN WINTER&#8221;</p>


<h4>16. THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER</h4>

<p>One warm summer day an Ant was busy gathering
food and laying it up for winter. A foolish little Grasshopper
who saw him said: &#8220;Oh, you poor slave, why do
you work so hard? See how I play and enjoy myself!
Play and sing with me.&#8221; &#8220;No, no,&#8221; replied the Ant;
&#8220;if I play now, what shall I have ready for winter?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t winter yet,&#8221; said the idle long-legs, as he
hopped off again to play. At last the cold, bitter winter
came. Then the Grasshopper went to the Ant to beg
for some food to keep from starving, but the Ant said,
&#8220;Those who play and dance all summer must expect to
dance hungry to bed in winter.&#8221;</p>


<h4>17. THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL</h4>

<p>Once a Fox went trot, trot, trot, toward a hen-roost
to catch a hen. But the farmer had set a trap in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Mr. Fox caught his long, bushy tail, and it came right off.
As he trotted back home, ashamed to be seen without his
tail, he said: &#8220;I know what I will do; I will tell the
foxes tails are ugly and useless. Let us cut them off.&#8221;
So he called all the foxes in council, but he took good
care to hold his back against a tree, so they could not
see that he did not have a tail. While he was making
his speech, urging them to cut off their tails, one little
fox peeped behind the tree and cried, &#8220;Oh! Oh! he has
lost his tail!&#8221; Then another fox gave him a push, and
as he ran off in shame, all the foxes laughed, &#8220;That is
why he wanted us to cut off our tails.&#8221;</p>


<h4>18. THE BOY AND THE ECHO</h4>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah!&#8221; shouted a boy in the woods one
day. &#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah!&#8221; some one shouted back. He
thought it must be another boy in the woods, and started
off to find him, but no other boy was to be seen anywhere.
&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; he called out. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;
came back at once. &#8220;You are mocking me!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;You are mocking me,&#8221; came again the voice. &#8220;You
are a goose,&#8221; the boy cried, becoming angry. &#8220;You are
a goose,&#8221; came back the same voice. The boy began to
cry, and ran home to tell his mother that a bad boy hiding
in the woods called him bad names. &#8220;Did he speak first
or you?&#8221; his mother asked. When he explained it all,
his mother said: &#8220;There was only one boy there, and you
were that boy, and what you heard was your echo. If
you had spoken kind words, only kind words would have
come back to you.&#8221;</p>


<h4>19. THE CAMEL IN THE TENT</h4>

<p>One cold night an Arab sat in his tent, and his Camel
asked if he might put his nose inside the tent to keep it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
warm. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the kind-hearted man. Soon the
Camel said, &#8220;Please let me put my neck inside,&#8221; which his
master permitted. &#8220;It will take no more room if I put
my two front feet inside too, will it?&#8221; pleaded the
Camel. The man moved a little to allow that. &#8220;May I
please put my hump in too?&#8221; begged the Camel. Then,
as soon as his hump was in, the Camel walked in altogether.
The Arab began to complain, but the Camel
said, &#8220;If you do not like this small space, you can go
outside yourself.&#8221; Then he gave the Arab a push that
landed him right out of his tent and stayed inside all by
himself. That was the Arab&#8217;s reward for allowing the
Camel to put his nose inside the tent.</p>


<h4>20. THE MONKEY AND THE CATS</h4>

<p>Two Cats who had stolen a large piece of cheese were
quarreling over dividing it. At last they decided to refer
the matter to a Monkey, who took a pair of scales and,
breaking the cheese into two pieces, placed a piece in
each scale. &#8220;Let me see,&#8221; he said, taking out the heavier
piece, &#8220;this piece weighs more than the other.&#8221; Then
he bit off quite a piece and put it back on the scale, and,
of course, it was lighter than the other piece. So he took
a mouthful from that side, and continued taking from
first one side and then the other, until the Cats cried,
&#8220;Hold! Hold! Give us the two pieces and we will be
satisfied.&#8221; &#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; replied the Monkey, &#8220;justice
must be given,&#8221; and he continued to nibble one piece
after another. The Cats saw their cheese was almost gone
and begged for what was left. &#8220;No, no, my friends,&#8221;
said the Monkey, &#8220;what remains belongs to me for my
pay!&#8221; So he crammed the rest into his mouth and
munched it in hearty enjoyment as he solemnly dismissed
the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>


<h4>21. THE LION AND THE MOUSE</h4>

<p>One day a Lion was lying fast asleep in a thick wood,
when a little Mouse, playing &#8220;hide-and-seek,&#8221; ran over
the Lion&#8217;s nose and awakened him. As quick as a flash
the Lion caught the Mouse under his paw. &#8220;O Lion,
do not eat me, please,&#8221; begged the Mouse, &#8220;I am such
a little thing. I could not make you a mouthful. Let me
go and some day I will do something to help you.&#8221; This
made the Lion laugh, but he let the Mouse scamper off.
Later on this good Lion was caught in a net and roared
in distress. The Mouse heard him and ran up and said,
&#8220;Now, Mr. Lion, I will do something to help you.&#8221;
&#8220;How can you?&#8221; roared the Lion. Quickly the Mouse
began to gnaw the net with his sharp little teeth. It
took a long time, but at last the Lion was free. The
Mouse laughed as he scampered away again, saying,
&#8220;Little friends may help as much as great friends. I
did help you after all, you see!&#8221;</p>


<h4>22. THE LARKS IN THE WHEAT-FIELD</h4>

<p>Once a Lark and her little ones lived together in a
nest in a field of ripened wheat. The mother bird was
afraid the reapers might come before the young larks
could fly. So every morning when she went for food she
told them to listen carefully to all they heard and tell
her when she returned. On the first evening they said,
&#8220;We heard the farmer tell his son to ask the neighbors to
help reap the wheat.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, no danger yet,&#8221; said Mother
Lark. The next evening they said, &#8220;We heard the
farmer tell his son to ask his uncle and cousins to help
reap the wheat.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, no danger yet!&#8221; said the mother.
On the third evening they said, &#8220;To-day we heard the
farmer say to his son, &#8216;To-morrow we will reap the
wheat ourselves!&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;Then,&#8221; cried the mother, &#8220;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
must fly away at once, for the wheat is sure to be cut
now. When a man makes up his mind to do a thing
himself, it is more likely to be done.&#8221; She took her
young ones away at once, and the next day the wheat
was reaped by the farmer and his son.</p>


<h4>23. THE MILLER AND HIS DONKEY</h4>

<p>Once an old Miller and his son were walking along a
country road behind their Donkey, which they were driving
to town to sell. On the way they met some girls
who said, &#8220;Look! What stupid people to walk instead
of riding.&#8221; Wishing to please them the old Miller
put his son on the Donkey and walked along by their
side. Soon they came to some men who shouted: &#8220;Look;
what a lazy lout! Are you not ashamed to ride, while
your poor old father walks?&#8221; Wishing to please them
the Miller told his son to get down while he mounted
and rode. Not long after they met some women who
cried, &#8220;Look, what a shame for that selfish old father
to ride while his son walks!&#8221; So the father, wishing
again to please, took up his son behind him. They had
not gone far when they met a man who said, &#8220;Look at
that shameful sight! Why, those two strong fellows are
better able to carry that poor beast than he is to carry
them.&#8221; Wishing to please him the Miller and his son got
down, tied the Donkey&#8217;s legs together between a long pole,
shouldered the load, and began carrying the Donkey in
this way along the road. When they came to the town
bridge they met a crowd of people who shouted with such
laughter and jeers at this funny sight of seeing them carrying
a Donkey, that the frightened animal kicked himself
loose, and fell over the bridge into the river and was
drowned. The Miller said to his son, &#8220;By trying to please
everybody we have pleased nobody and lost our Donkey.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<h4>24. THE PERSIAN AND HIS SONS</h4>

<p>Once there was a Persian Ruler, who lived in a great
palace with his three sons. The father had a beautiful
pearl which he decided to give to the son which showed
himself the noblest. He called the three boys before him
and asked each to tell the noblest deed he had performed
in the last month. The eldest said: &#8220;Father, as I was
traveling in a foreign land, a merchant trusted me with
many valuable jewels, and he did not count them. I
might easily have kept one or two and they would not
have been missed, but I carried those jewels and delivered
them all as safely as though they had been my own.&#8221;
&#8220;My son,&#8221; said the father, &#8220;you were honest, and did a
noble deed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said the second son, &#8220;as I was walking in
the country the other day, I saw a child playing by a lake,
and while I watched, the child fell in and I saved the
child.&#8221; &#8220;You have done your duty,&#8221; said the father,
&#8220;and you too have done a noble deed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said the third boy, &#8220;as I crossed over the
mountain the other day, I saw a man who had done me
a great wrong, sleeping near the edge of a dangerous
precipice. I would have walked by without a word, only
something within me called me to go back and awake
him lest he fall over the precipice and be killed. I did
this, knowing all the time that the man would not understand,
and that he would be angry with me, as, indeed,
he was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My son,&#8221; cried the father, &#8220;your deed was the
noblest. To do good to an enemy without hope of reward
is indeed the noblest of all. The pearl is yours!&#8221;</p>

FOLK-TALES</h3></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Adapted for Children, Six to Twelve Years.</i>)</p>


<h4>1. WHY THE BEAR HAS A STUMPY TAIL</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> day a Bear met a Fox, who was slinking along
with a string of fish he had stolen. &#8220;Where did
you get those nice fish?&#8221; said the Bear. &#8220;That&#8217;s telling,&#8221;
laughed the Fox; &#8220;but if you want to get some, go out
on the ice, cut a hole in it, and stick your tail down in the
hole and hold your tail there until you feel a bite. The
longer you hold your tail in the hole the more fish you
will get. Then all at once pull your tail out sidewise with
a strong jerk.&#8221; The Bear went down to the ice and held
his tail a long, long time in the hole until it was frozen
fast in. Then he jerked it out with a side pull, and his
tail snapped short off. And people used to think that is
why the Bear has a stumpy tail.</p>


<h4>2. WHY THE ROBIN&#8217;S BREAST IS RED</h4>

<p>Far, far away to the North, in the bitter winter, a
hunter and his little son sat down beside their fire, watching
it day and night. They knew well that unless it was
kept burning the people would freeze and the Bear would
have the Northland all to himself. But one night when
the father was ill and the boy was so tired that he fell
fast asleep, the Bear stole up quietly and poked the fire
with his big, wet paws. Thinking the fire was out, he
went quickly away to his cave. But as soon as the Bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was gone, a little gray Robin flew down and fanned a
tiny blue spark into a flame with her wings. As she did
this, the little Robin&#8217;s breast was burned red. But wherever
she flew after that, over all the woods, a fire began
to burn, and the whole Northland became full of fires,
and so the Bear did not have all the North country to
himself. For a thousand years the people of the North
have had a great love for the Robin. And they tell their
children this story why the Robin&#8217;s breast became red.&mdash;<i>Adapted

<h4>3. THE MAN IN THE MOON</h4>

<p>&#8220;Go out into the forest and gather sticks for the fire,&#8221;
said the wood-cutter&#8217;s wife to her husband. &#8220;To-morrow
will be Sunday, and we have no wood to burn.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will go.&#8221; He went to the forest, but
instead of getting the fire-wood, he sat by the bank of a
stream and fished all day, and late at night went home
without any wood. His wife was already asleep and did
not know what he had done. Early the next morning he
crept out to the forest, intending to bring wood before
she would be astir. He cut the wood, and began carrying
the bundle of sticks on his back, when a voice behind him
said, &#8220;Put the wood down.&#8221; &#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my
wife cannot cook dinner without it.&#8221; &#8220;You will have no
dinner to-day,&#8221; said the voice. &#8220;My wife will not know
I did not bring wood last night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Put the
wood down! It is Sunday, the day when men should
rest from their work.&#8221; &#8220;Sunday or Monday,&#8221; said the
man, &#8220;it is all one to me.&#8221; &#8220;Then,&#8221; said the voice,
&#8220;if you will not keep Sunday on earth, you shall keep
Monday in the heavens, and you shall carry your wood
until the Judgment Day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man could not tell how it was, but he felt himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
being lifted up, up, up, sticks and all, till he was in the
moon. &#8220;Here you shall stay,&#8221; said the voice. On any
clear night, when you look up at the moon, you can still
see a great shadow, like an old man with wood on his
shoulder.</p>


<h4>4. PROMETHEUS, THE GREEK FIRE-GIVER<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h4>

<p>Long ago the Greek people believed that the world
was ruled by many gods. They thought Jupiter was the
father, with many powerful children. One of these was
Prometheus, meaning &#8220;Forethought.&#8221; This god had a
kind heart, and longed to help the poor and unhappy men
of earth who lived in caves and holes in the rocks, hungry
and cold. They ate their food raw, like the beasts. They
had no tools, nor comforts. Prometheus said: &#8220;Poor
man, how I pity him! If he only had fire, then he would
be happy. Yes, man shall have fire, even if Jupiter kills
me.&#8221; So one dark night he set out for Mount Olympus,
the abode of the gods, stole a lighted brand, hid it in his
bosom, and brought it down to man. &#8220;See the gift I
bring you!&#8221; he cried. It was midwinter. Snows were
deep on the ground. Ice covered the rivers. Men were
shivering in the cold and little children were freezing.
Prometheus laid wood together and touched it with his
firebrand, and lo! the first fire on earth was started! Blue
fingers were spread out to the wonderful warmth. Pinched
faces smiled in the golden glow. &#8220;Summer is come
again!&#8221; they shouted. They called Prometheus, the
helper of man. But he became their teacher too. He
showed them how to cook their food, make tools, and dig
metals from the earth, and soon man was warm and
happy and busy. One day Jupiter looked down from his
high throne on the topmost peak of Mount Olympus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
saw the fire-theft. In fearful anger he ordered his son,
Vulcan, the blacksmith of the gods, to seize Prometheus,
carry him away to the Caucasian Mountains, chain
him fast to a huge rock, where a great vulture tore out his
liver. There Prometheus suffered for ages; but generation
after generation of men lived on earth, and died,
blessing him for the gift he had brought to them. After
many centuries of woe, Hercules found Prometheus,
killed the vulture, broke the chain, and set free the suffering
god, who said, &#8220;I am glad man has the fire-gift!&#8221;
And the sight of man warming himself beside it and
using it comforted him.</p>


<h4>5. PHAETHON&#8217;S WONDERFUL RIDE</h4>

<p>The Greeks believed that Apollo was the god of music
and of hunting, and also of the sun. Every day, they
thought, he rode through the sky in his golden chariot,
drawn by fiery horses. One day Phaethon, meaning &#8220;the
Bright and Shining One,&#8221; his son, said, &#8220;Father, let me
drive your chariot for one day.&#8221; &#8220;My son,&#8221; said Apollo,
&#8220;I cannot grant your request! &#8217;Tis a mischief, not a
gift, you ask. The road is steep and the four fiery steeds
untamed. You would grow dizzy and fall and set the
world on fire.&#8221; But Phaethon pleaded and, because he
had promised, at last Apollo ordered the Hours to harness
the horses and fling wide open the palace-gates. Phaethon
took the reins and the whip in his hands. &#8220;My son,&#8221;
said Apollo, &#8220;be sure to watch the horses with the greatest
care, and do not use the whip.&#8221; At first Phaethon remembered
his father&#8217;s words and he enjoyed his ride;
but soon he became reckless and drove faster and faster
until he lost his way. In trying to find it again he drove
so near the earth that immediately trees shriveled, harvests
withered, fountains dried up, cities were burned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
ashes, and even the people of the land over which he was
passing were burned black&mdash;which color the Negroes
have to this day. This frightened Phaethon so much that
he whipped up his horses, and drove them so far away
that the earth turned to a sudden cold. The cries of the
suffering people rose in chorus to Jupiter, who awoke
from his deep sleep, and at once hurled his deadliest
thunderbolt straight at the foolhardy Phaethon. In a moment
the dead boy fell like a shooting star into the waters
of a deep river. His intimate friend, Cycnus, continually
plunged into the river in hope of finding all the scattered
pieces of his body, until the gods changed him into a
swan. And that is the reason, the Greeks thought, why
the swan is ever mournfully sailing about, and often
plunging his head into the water to continue his sad
search for Phaethon.</p>


<h4>6. THE STORY OF THE SUNFLOWER</h4>

<p>Clytie was a water-nymph who lived in a cave at the
bottom of the sea. She had never seen the earth or sky or
stars or sun or light of day, in her dark home, deep in
the sea. One morning she floated up so far that she
reached the surface and swam to the beautiful green
shore. Shaking the water out of her waving yellow
hair, she sat and watched a golden ball which was arising
out of the east. It was the sun. With wonder and delight
her eyes followed him as he mounted higher and
higher. It became noon, but Clytie never stirred. She
scarcely seemed to breathe. Soon the sun sank lower and
lower toward the west, and Clytie&#8217;s eyes still followed
him with love. Then the sun sank from sight. Clytie
fell upon her face in sorrow, crying, &#8220;Oh, the miracle!
shall I ever see it again? I will not leave this spot. I
will wait to see if the wonder may not return.&#8221; So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
through the long night she watched, and in the white
light of dawn the great sun burst again in beauty upon
the waiting eyes of Clytie, who followed him in his
course, turning her sweet, sad face, east, south, and west
as the day advanced. This she did day after day, until
at last the gods, in pity, changed her into the sunflower.
But the sunflower still follows, with upturned face, the
daily journey of the sun.</p>

<h4>7. THE GOLDEN TOUCH</h4>

<p>Once there was a King, named Midas, who loved gold
better than anything else in the world. Every day he
went down into a dark room in his castle to play with his
piles of gold, and to see them shine. One morning, before
he arose from his bed, he sighed: &#8220;I wish I had the
whole world for my treasure-room, and that it was full
of gold all my own, then I would be very happy!&#8221;
Just then a voice said, &#8220;Midas, you are a very rich man.
You ought to be the happiest man in the world.&#8221; &#8220;I
am not,&#8221; said the King; &#8220;but I would be if everything I
touched would turn to gold.&#8221; &#8220;Are you sure you would
not be sorry you made such a choice?&#8221; said the voice.
&#8220;How could I be sorry? I would be the happiest man
in the world!&#8221; &#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; said the voice, &#8220;you
shall have the Golden Touch.&#8221; Just then a little sunbeam
came through the window shining on his bed. He
put out his hand and touched the coverlet, and it was
turned to gold. He sprang from his bed and ran about
the room, turning everything to gold. Then he dressed
himself and was delighted to find his clothes became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
golden garments, and his spectacles turned to gold.
Going down-stairs he went out into the garden, and kept
plucking roses which changed into beautiful, shining gold.
Even the dewdrops became little nuggets of gold. Then
he went back into the house to breakfast, and had great
fun changing his daughter&#8217;s bread and milk bowl into
gold. Just then his daughter, Marygold, came into the
room crying, &#8220;Oh, my beautiful roses are all ugly and
yellow and without any fragrance.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; said
her father; &#8220;let us eat.&#8221; But as soon as he touched his
breakfast, the baked potatoes, fish, and cakes all became
gold. He raised the cup of coffee to his lips. That
too turned to gold, and of course he could not drink it.
He looked at Marygold who was quietly eating her bread
and milk. How he longed to have just one taste. Seeing
her father&#8217;s sad face, Marygold ran to him, but as soon
as he took her in his arms and kissed her she too became
hard, shining gold, and even her tears were little nuggets
of gold. Poor, unhappy King! His heart was sad. He
threw himself on the floor and tried to pray, but the words
would not come. All at once the room grew bright, and
a voice said, &#8220;How do you like the Golden Touch?&#8221; &#8220;I
hate the very name of gold!&#8221; cried the King. &#8220;I would
give all I have just to see my daughter smile again.&#8221;
&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the voice, &#8220;take a pitcher, go to the river,
jump in head first and fill the pitcher with water; then
sprinkle a few drops of it on everything you have changed
to gold. Everything will become as before.&#8221; The King
quickly did all the voice said. The first thing he did
with the water was to sprinkle Marygold, who at once
opened her eyes in life again. Then he went into the
garden and changed the roses back to their natural beauty
and fragrance. Nor did he stop until he had sprinkled
water on everything he had changed to gold. Then he
ate his breakfast with great joy. Only two things were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
left to remind him of the Golden Touch&mdash;the sand in
the river and Marygold&#8217;s hair. As this made her more
beautiful, Midas said that was the only gold he cared
for after that.&mdash;<i>Adapted from Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8220;Tanglewood
Tales.&#8221;</i></p>


<h4>8. SAINT GEORGE AND THE DRAGON</h4>

<p>Once upon a time in the early days of the Christians,
in the reign of the Emperor Diocletian, there was born
in the province of Cappadocia, in Asia Minor, a beautiful
baby boy, named George, who grew up to be a brave
soldier and knight. Once when he was on a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land he came to a town in the country of
Libya where the people were living in great terror because
a great dragon, with poisonous breath, had his
home in a marsh outside the city walls. The monster had
devoured their sheep and oxen, and the people were
forced to shut themselves close inside their city and send
out each day a sheep to satisfy the hunger of this dreadful
dragon. At last not one sheep was left. Then the
King ordered that each day two children, chosen by lot,
should be sent out to the dragon. The people obeyed the
King&#8217;s order and from day to day arose the bitter cries
of parents upon whose children the cruel lot had fallen.
But one morning the lot fell upon Cleodolinda, the beautiful
fifteen-year-old daughter of the King. He was in
despair, for he loved his little daughter most tenderly.
He offered all the gold in the treasury and half his kingdom
if she should be spared. But the parents who had
been obliged to sacrifice their children insisted that the
King&#8217;s daughter should be given to the dragon, and
threatened to burn the King in his palace if he did not
send her forth at once. The King pleaded for eight days
longer to bid farewell to her. Then he sent her forth
weeping, and arrayed in her royal robes, to die for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
people. Walking timidly toward the terrible monster&#8217;s
den, along the path strewn thick with the bleaching bones
of her former playmates, she suddenly heard the sound
of hurrying horse&#8217;s hoofs. She looked up, and there
was a beautiful young knight in armor, on a milk-white
horse, coming toward her with a gleaming spear, ready
to do battle with any enemy that might cross his path.
She cried, &#8220;Fly! fly for your life, Sir Knight!&#8221; But
when he had heard her sad story, he said: &#8220;God forbid
that I should fly! I will destroy this monster, your
enemy, and deliver you through the power that lives in
all true followers of Christ.&#8221; Just then the dragon came
forth, half flying and half crawling toward them, clashing
his bronze scales with horrid noise. Cleodolinda again
begged the knight to fly and leave her to her fate. But
Saint George made the sign of the cross and rushed upon
the monster. The struggle was fierce and long, for it
was hard to strike through the dragon&#8217;s bronze scales.
But at last, with a blow like that of three strong men,
Saint George pinned the dragon to the earth with his
lance. Cleodolinda did not run away but, &#8220;with folded
hands and knees full truly bent,&#8221; the brave girl stood
near her champion, who said: &#8220;Touch him and see how
tame he is. See, even his poisonous breath is gone. It is
the power of good over evil.&#8221; Then he took the girl&#8217;s rich
girdle, bound it round the great dragon, and gave one
end to her, telling her to lead the dragon into the city.
So the girl who had obediently gone out to the dragon
expecting him to devour her, obediently led the powerless
creature over the fields he had laid waste and over
the bleaching bones of the children he had devoured, and
the meek monster followed her like a lamb toward the
walls of the city where the people were gathered in terror.
Saint George called out: &#8220;Fear not, only believe in
the Christ through whose might I have overpowered your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
enemy, and I will destroy the dragon before your eyes.&#8221;
Then he took his sword and smote off the dragon&#8217;s head,
and all the people hailed him as their deliverer. But
Saint George bade them give God the praise. He
preached to them so earnestly that the King and princess
and all the people became Christians. He would not take
the gold the King offered him, but ordered that it be distributed
among the poor. Then he bade them all adieu
and rode away to do in other lands like noble deeds of
loving service. So this champion of the weak became the
patron saint of merry England, and only the bravest
knight or soldier may wear the cross and be called a
Knight of Saint George.</p>


<h4>9. SAINT PATRICK AND THE SNAKES</h4>

<p>If you should ever sail across the ocean to Ireland, and
travel on that Emerald Isle, you would be sure to hear
many interesting stories about the good missionary, Saint
Patrick. One story which was told many years ago by
an old monk named Jocelin, is this:</p>

<p>Long, long ago, when Ireland was called Erin, and
before Saint Patrick came to the island, the people were
troubled with a plague of demons and reptiles. Patrick
was the son of a Christian magistrate who lived in England.
In the year A. D. 411, when Patrick was fifteen,
some wild Irish raiders stole him and sold him as a slave
in Ireland, where he remained in slavery for six years
tending pigs upon the mountains. When this Christian
boy, Patrick, made his escape to France, he resolved to
return to Ireland and devote himself as a missionary to
the conversion of the people. When he returned to
Ireland to enter upon his mission, he found the country
stricken because of the demons and reptiles. By means of
a wondrous staff which he stretched toward heaven, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
a holy bell, Fuin Foya, which when he rang was heard
throughout Erin, he drove away the demons with howls
of rage. Then, as he went about the land preaching and
doing good to all the people, he found them still suffering
with the plague of snakes and toads, which ugly reptiles
he drove westward until they reached a high rock, when,
with a hissing sound, they turned upon Saint Patrick
and tried to poison him. But the saint was armed with
his melodious bell, which had been given by the angels,
and of all sounds in the world the ringing of a heavenly
bell is most terrible to a reptile, and the silvery tones of
this bell frightened the snakes and toads more than all the
bells of the land ringing together. When Saint Patrick
saw these wicked serpents making ready to sting him,
and saw they all no longer obeyed his commands and his
threats, he uncovered the bell and the moment they heard
the first tinkle they rushed forward in a body to scramble
up the side of the hill and away from the sound they
hated. As soon as they reached the top they began to
sway to and fro in their fright, for there, far beneath the
dark rocks, lay the blue waters of the ocean. But they
could not wait there long, for as soon as Saint Patrick
came to the summit, he made a sign for them to come
near him, and, creeping and crawling, they cowered at
his feet, waiting to hear their doom. The good Saint
Patrick stood over them and, lifting his staff in his hand,
he pointed out far over the sea. &#8220;Forward, every one
into the sea!&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;and henceforth this
blessed Isle of Erin shall be free forever from your power
of evil!&#8221; They lay at his feet hissing and writhing in
agony, but Saint Patrick began to uncover his bell, Fuin
Foya. As soon as they saw that, the reptiles rushed and
tumbled down, down over the steep rocks. So, hissing
and howling, they plunged into the sea and disappeared
under the waves.</p>

<h4>10. THE COYOTE AND THE INDIAN FIRE-BRINGER</h4>

<p>One cold winter&#8217;s day, long, long ago, when the Coyote
was the friend and the counselor of the Indian, a Boy of
one of the tribes was ranging through a mountain forest
with a big, gray Coyote. The poor Indians ran naked in
the snow or huddled in caves in the rocks, and were suffering
terribly in the cold. The Boy said, &#8220;I am sorry
for the misery of my people.&#8221; &#8220;I do not feel the cold,&#8221;
said the Coyote. &#8220;You have a coat of fur,&#8221; said the Boy,
&#8220;and my people have not. I will hunt with you no more
until I have found a way to make my people warm in the
winter&#8217;s cold. Help me, O counselor.&#8221; The Coyote ran
away, and when he came back, after a long time, he said,
&#8220;I have a way, but it&#8217;s a hard way.&#8221; &#8220;No way is too
hard,&#8221; said the Boy. So the Coyote told him they must
go to the Burning Mountain to bring fire to the people.
&#8220;What is fire?&#8221; asked the Boy. &#8220;Fire is red like a flower,
yet not a flower; swift to run in the grass and destroy,
like a beast, yet not a beast; fierce and beautiful, yet a
good servant to keep one warm, if kept among stones
and fed with sticks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will get the fire,&#8221; said the Boy. So the Boy and
the Coyote started off with one hundred swift runners
for the far-away Burning Mountain. At the end of the
first day&#8217;s trail they left the weakest of the runners to
wait; at the end of the second day the next stronger,
and so for each of the hundred days; and the Boy was
the strongest runner and went to the last trail with the
Coyote. At last the two stood at the foot of the Burning
Mountain, from which smoke rolled out. Then the
Coyote said to the Boy, &#8220;Stay here till I bring you a
brand from the burning. Be ready for running, for I
shall be faint when I reach you, and the Fire-spirits will
pursue me.&#8221; Up the mountainside he went. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
so slinking and so small and so mean, the Fire-spirits
laughed at him. But in the night, as the Fire-spirits were
dancing about the mountain, the Coyote stole the fire and
ran with it fast away from the Fire-spirits who, red and
angry, gave chase after him, but could not overtake him.
The Boy saw him coming, like a falling star against the
mountain, with the fire in his mouth, the sparks of which
streamed out along his sides. As soon as the Coyote got
near, the Boy took the brand from his jaws and was off,
like an arrow from a bent bow, till he reached the next
runner, who stood with his head bent for running. To
him he passed it, and he was off and away, and the spiteful
Fire-spirits were hot in chase. So the brand passed
from hand to hand and the Fire-spirits tore after each
runner through the country, but they came to the mountains
of the snows ahead and could not pass. Then the
swift runners, one after the other bore it forward, shining
starlight in the night, glowing red in the sultry noons,
pale in the twilight, until they came safely to their own
land. There they kept the fire among the stones and
fed it with sticks, as the Coyote had said, and it kept the
people warm.</p>

<p>Ever after, the Boy was called the Fire-bringer, and
the Indians said the Coyote still bears the mark of fire,
because his flanks are singed and yellow from the flames
that streamed backward from the firebrand that night
in the long ago.&mdash;<i>Adapted from &#8220;The Basket Woman,&#8221;

<h4>1. THE UGLY DUCKLING</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time a Duck was sitting all alone on
her nest watching for her young ducklings to hatch.
All at once the eggs seemed alive. &#8220;Peep! Peep!&#8221; and
one little fluffy yellow head after another looked out.
&#8220;Quack! Quack!&#8221; said the Duck, and all the ducklings
quacked too, as well as they could. But one egg still
remained unhatched, and it was the largest egg of all.
&#8220;I must sit on it a little longer,&#8221; said Mother Duck
very tenderly. This she did until at last the large egg
cracked and out tumbled a large, ugly, gray Duckling.
He seemed so different from the others that the mother
thought sure that he must be a turkey, until she saw him
swim in the water, just as well as her other children.
But he was not so pretty as the others, and the poor, ugly
Duckling was bitten and pecked and chased and kicked
about and made fun of by all, and even his own brothers
and sisters were unkind to him. At last he could bear
it no longer, and he ran away, going on and on until he
came to a swamp where the wild geese lived. &#8220;Bang!
Bang!&#8221; went a gun in the morning, and two of the geese
fell dead. In a moment more a large, terrible dog ran
up. He put his nose close to the Duckling, showing his
sharp teeth, and then &#8220;Splash! Splash!&#8221; he went out of
the water without touching him. &#8220;I am so ugly a dog
will not bite me,&#8221; the poor bird said, lying still until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
gun stopped shooting. In the evening he flew away from
the swamp and came to a hut where an old woman lived
with a cat and a hen. These made so much fun of him
because he was so ugly that he flew away from them
and was very lonely and sad among the rushes all the
long, cold winter until the spring came. Then one morning
he flew on and on until he came to a large, beautiful
garden where he saw three white swans moving on the
smooth water. &#8220;I will fly to them,&#8221; he said. As soon as
they saw him they swam toward him and began to stroke
his neck with their beaks. Just then he looked down into
the clear water, and was surprised at his own image. He
saw himself no longer a dark, gray, ugly duckling, but a
beautiful snow-white swan like the others. Little children
running about the garden came up to throw bread and
cake into the water. &#8220;Oh, see!&#8221; cried one of the children.
&#8220;There is a new one! The new one is the prettiest!&#8221;
The Swan was so happy he did not know what to
do. He was not at all proud, but he shook his beautiful
feathers, stretched his graceful, slender neck, and said:
&#8220;Now, when people see me they will be glad! I never
dreamed of such happiness when I was an ugly duckling!&#8221;&mdash;<i>Adapted
from Hans Christian Andersen.</i></p>


<h4>2. THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER</h4>

<p>Once there were three brothers, Hans, Swartz, and
Gluck, the youngest. These three brothers owned a rich
farm in a valley far up on the mountainside. The apples
that grew there were so red, the corn so yellow, the
grapes so blue, and everything was so fertile that it was
called &#8220;Treasure Valley.&#8221; On the very top of the mountain
a river shone so bright and golden when lighted by
the rays of the setting sun that people called it the
&#8220;Golden River,&#8221; but its waters flowed down on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
side of the mountain. The two older brothers were so
selfish and cruel that they were called the &#8220;Black
Brothers.&#8221; They beat their brother Gluck so cruelly one
day for being kind to some one that the West Wind
punished them by blowing, blowing, blowing so hard that
everything became dry and the valley became a desert.
Then the three brothers went to live in the town, and the
two oldest went from bad to worse, until one day they
said, &#8220;We have nothing left in the world but Gluck&#8217;s
Golden Pitcher.&#8221; This pitcher was a gift from his uncle,
which Gluck highly prized, but the cruel brothers ordered
him, while they were away, to put it into the melting-pot
and make it into gold spoons that they might secure
money to support them. While the melting-pot with the
gold pitcher in it was warming over the hot fire, Gluck
looked out of the window and saw the sun reflecting its
yellow glow in the Golden River, far up on the mountain
crest. He sighed, &#8220;How fine it would be if only that
river were really gold. We wouldn&#8217;t be poor then!&#8221;
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be fine at all,&#8221; said a thin little voice from
the melting-pot. &#8220;Pour me out! Pour me out! I&#8217;m
too hot,&#8221; continued the thin little voice. It was the King
of the Golden River, a queer little dwarf, who peeped
out of the melting-pot and said: &#8220;Whoever climbs to the
top of the mountain where the Golden River begins, and
pours in three drops of holy water, shall find the river
turned into gold. But whoever fails at the first trial
can have no other, and will be changed into a big black
boulder.&#8221; With these words the King of the Golden
River vanished up the chimney. Just then the two
brothers knocked at the door and came in, and when
they saw the golden pitcher all melted away and vanished
in smoke up the chimney, they beat poor Gluck black and
blue for his carelessness. When Gluck told them what
the King of the Golden River had said, at first they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
not believe him, and then they quarreled so terribly over
which should be the first to go, that a policeman came and
Swartz was thrown into prison. Then Hans said, &#8220;I
will be the first to get the gold.&#8221; He took a bottle of
water and climbed up, up, up the mountainside until he
met a dog so thirsty that his tongue hung from his mouth.
Hans gave the dog a kick and passed on until he met a
little child, who said, &#8220;I&#8217;m so thirsty.&#8221; But Hans gave
the child a slap and passed on until he met a queer little
old man, who cried, &#8220;Water! Water! I&#8217;m dying for
water!&#8221; Hans spoke bad words and passed on, drinking
up all the water himself. So when he came to the source
of the Golden River he found that all his water was
gone, and he did not have even three drops to put into
the river. Then, in a rage, he threw the empty bottle into
the stream, and immediately there was great thunder and
lightning, and Hans was changed into a big black
boulder.</p>

<p>When Hans did not return, Gluck went to work in a
goldsmith&#8217;s shop to earn money enough to get Swartz out
of prison. As soon as he was released he said, &#8220;Now I
will try to get the gold.&#8221; So Swartz took a bottle of
water and climbed up, up, up the mountainside, passing
the poor, thirsty dog, the little child, and the queer little
old man dying of thirst, without so much as sharing one
drop of water with them. When he came to the source
of the Golden River he found that all his water was
gone and he did not have even three drops to pour into
the river. Then, in a rage, he threw the empty bottle into
the stream, and immediately there was great thunder
and lightning, and Swartz was changed into a big black
boulder beside his brother.</p>

<p>Gluck waited long for his brothers to return, but when
they did not come he took a bottle of water and started
to climb up, up, up the mountainside until he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
to the poor thirsty dog, and the little child, and then the
queer little old man, with each of whom Gluck kindly
shared the water from his bottle, and when he reached
the top of the mountain he found he had plenty of water
still in his bottle. So he poured in three drops of his holy
water into the heart of the river, but, to his surprise, he
found that the river did not change into gold. The water
began to flow down the other side of the mountain toward
Treasure Valley. He was disappointed and sad. Then
the King of the Golden River appeared again and said,
&#8220;Follow the stream!&#8221; Then he noticed, as he went
down the mountainside, that everywhere the river flowed
flowers and vines and fruit trees blossomed, and soon all
Treasure Valley was one rich, beautiful garden again.
Then he saw that the river was indeed, as the King had
said, a River of Gold. After that Gluck lived in a beautiful
home in Treasure Valley. His apples were red, his
corn was yellow, his grapes were blue, and everything
became prosperous again. But the hungry and thirsty
were never once sent empty away.&mdash;<i>Adapted from John
Ruskin.</i></p>


<h4>3. THE CLOUD</h4>

<p>One hot summer morning a little Cloud rose out of the
sea and floated happily across the blue sky. Far below
lay the earth, brown and dry and desolate from drought.
The little Cloud could see the poor earth-people working
and suffering in the heat, while she floated here and there
in the sky without a care. &#8220;Oh, if I could only help
those people,&#8221; said the Cloud. &#8220;If I could make their
work easier and give the hungry ones food and the
thirsty ones drink! Yes, I will help, I will!&#8221; And she
began to sink softly down to the earth. As she sank
lower she remembered when she was a tiny cloud-child
in the lap of Mother Ocean she was told that if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
clouds went too near the earth they would die. Thinking
of that she held herself from sinking and swayed herself
here and there in the breeze. Then she said, &#8220;Men of
earth, come what may, I will help. I will.&#8221; All at once
she became so large and wide-spread that the men of
earth were afraid; the trees and the grasses bowed themselves;
a wonderful light glowed from her heart; the
sound of thunder rolled through the sky, and a love
greater than words can tell filled the Cloud. Down,
down, close to earth she swept, and gave up her life in a
heavy shower of rain. That rain was the Cloud&#8217;s generous
deed, but it was her death, and it was her glory too.
Over the whole country round, as far as the rain fell, a
lovely rainbow spread its arch, and all the brightest rays
of heaven made its colors. It was the last greeting of a
love so great as to sacrifice itself. Soon the rainbow
was gone, but long, long after, the men and women,
saved by the Cloud, kept her blessing in their hearts.&mdash;<i>Adapted

<h4>4. THE GREAT STONE FACE</h4>

<p>Far up in the mountains of New England there was a
great rock in such a position as to resemble the features
of a human face. There were the broad arch of the forehead,
the eyes, the nose, and the lips. So real was it,
the Great Stone Face seemed to be alive. Happy were
the children who grew up to manhood or womanhood
with this Great Stone Face before their eyes, for the features
were all so noble and their expression like the glow
of a great, warm heart, it was an education to look at it.
There was a belief among the people who lived in the
valley, that one day a boy would be born who would become
the greatest and noblest man of his times, and
whose face would exactly resemble the Great Stone Face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
After a long time a boy grew up in the valley who learned
to love the sight of this image. After his day&#8217;s work
was done he would gaze up at it until he thought it
seemed to notice him and give him a smile of kindness
and encouragement in response to his look of love. Very
often during those years a rumor arose that the great
man foretold for ages had at last appeared. A boy who
had grown up in the valley, had gone away and become a
millionaire, returned, and people said, &#8220;This is he!&#8221;
But it proved untrue. Then a soldier, and a statesman,
and a poet arose, and people said, &#8220;This is he!&#8221; But it
was not so. Meanwhile, the boy who quietly day by
day lived, and labored, and looked up, and loved the
Great Stone Face grew to manhood, becoming more and
more like it, until one day everybody saw the resemblance,
and cried, &#8220;This is he!&#8221; And it was. This good boy
and young man had gradually grown in gentleness and
goodness and love until his face became as magnetic and
his influence as helpful in the valley as the Great Stone
Face.&mdash;<i>Adapted from Hawthorne.</i></p>


<h4>5. TOM, THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Written by Canon Kingsley for his own little boy.</i>)</p>

<p>Once there was a chimney-sweep, and his name was
Tom. He lived in a great city, where there were plenty
of chimneys to sweep. He never washed himself, he
never had been taught to say his prayers, he could not
read or write. One morning Tom and his master, Mr.
Grimes, started off to sweep some chimneys in the country.
Mr. Grimes rode the donkey, and Tom, with his
brushes, walked behind. They overtook a poor old Irish
woman, trudging along with a bundle on her back. She
had a shawl on her head and a red dress. She spoke
kindly to Tom, and they walked along together until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
they came to a spring. The master jumped from the
donkey and dipped his head into the water, shaking his
ears to dry them. Tom said, &#8220;Master, I never saw you
wash before.&#8221; &#8220;Nor will you see me wash again, most
likely. I did it for coolness, not for cleanliness. I&#8217;d be
ashamed to want washing every week or so like any
smutty collier-lad.&#8221; &#8220;I wish I might wash,&#8221; said poor
little Tom. &#8220;Come along,&#8221; said Grimes. &#8220;What do you
want with washing yourself?&#8221; and he began beating the
poor boy. &#8220;Shame on you!&#8221; cried the old woman.
&#8220;They that wish to be clean, clean they will be; they that
wish to be dirty, dirty they will be. Remember!&#8221;</p>

<p>That day Tom swept so many chimneys that he got
lost, and came down the wrong chimney in one house,
and found himself standing in a room the like of which
he had never seen before. There was a wash-stand
with a basin and soap and brushes and towels. Looking
toward the bed he held his breath, for there, under the
snow-white coverlet, was the most beautiful little girl
Tom had ever seen. &#8220;Are all the people like that when
they are washed?&#8221; he thought. Then he looked at his
wrists and tried to rub off the soot, and wondered if
it ever would come off. Looking round he saw standing
close to him a little, ugly, black, ragged boy with red
eyes and grinning white teeth. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What does such a little black monkey want here?&#8221;
But it was himself reflected in the great mirror, the like
of which also Tom had never seen before. Tom found
out then, for the first time, that he was dirty. He burst
into tears and turned to sneak up the chimney again to
hide himself, but he upset the fender and threw the fire-irons
down with a great noise. Under the window there
was a great tree, and Tom went down the tree like a cat
and across the garden toward the woods. The gardener,
who was busily engaged in watering the rose-bushes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
saw him and gave chase; the milkmaid heard the noise
and followed too; and so did the groom and the plowman,
and the old Irish woman and Mr. Grimes. But Tom ran
faster than all, and in the woods he was lost from view,
and all went back again. On the bank of a river Tom
sat down to rest, and was soon fast asleep and dreaming
of the little clean girl and the Irish woman who said,
&#8220;They that wish to be clean, clean they will be.&#8221; All at
once he cried out, &#8220;I must be clean! I must be clean!&#8221;
He awoke and went into the water, where he washed his
feet, and suddenly he was changed into a Water-baby.
Hundreds of other Water-babies were there, laughing and
singing and shouting and romping in the clear, cool water,
and all dressed in their little bathing-suits, so clean and
white. The one that had been poor little Tom, the
chimney-sweep, was the happiest and whitest among
them all. And he never forgot the old Irish woman
(who was really Queen of the Water-babies) or what
she had said: &#8220;They that wish to be clean, clean they will
be; they that wish to be dirty, dirty they will be.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Adapted
from &#8220;The Water-babies.&#8221;</i></p>


<h4>6. WHERE LOVE IS, GOD IS</h4>

<p>Once in a little town in Russia there was a lonely old
cobbler who lived in a cellar. There was always plenty
of work for him, for he was prompt and honest and
industrious. But the cobbler was not happy, for it
seemed to him God had been unkind to him in taking
away his wife and children by death. But at last a
good priest came and taught this unhappy cobbler to
read the New Testament, and then he grew happy and
contented, and changed in every way. One day as he
was reading how the Lord was treated when he was on
earth, he said to himself, &#8220;And suppose he came to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
would I treat him differently?&#8221; &#8220;Martin!&#8221;&mdash;and a
Voice seemed close to his ear. &#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; the cobbler
said; but no reply came. &#8220;Martin, Martin,&#8221; said
the Voice again, &#8220;look to-morrow on the street; I am coming!&#8221;
Next morning Martin waited and waited, but saw
no stranger come near. An old soldier, whom he knew,
came into his shop out of the snow, to whom the cobbler
gave a cup of tea and whom he treated with kindness as
he told him he was expecting his little Father, Christ.
Later in the day a poor widow with a little child came
into his shop out of the cold, to whom the cobbler gave
warm food and a coat and some money, as he told her
how he was expecting the Lord to come to him that day.
In the late afternoon the cobbler saw from his cellar
window a poor apple-woman fighting a boy who had
stolen some of her apples. The cobbler rushed into the
street and told the woman she ought to forgive the boy
as the Lord forgave us. He purchased an apple which
he gave to the boy, who, touched by the kindness, begged
the apple-woman&#8217;s pardon and kindly helped her by
carrying her heavy basket for her.</p>

<p>By the evening lamp-light the cobbler opened his New
Testament and was disappointed because the Christ-guest
had not come. Then a Voice whispered, &#8220;Martin! Dost
thou not know me?&#8221; &#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; cried the cobbler.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis I,&#8221; cried the Voice. &#8220;Lo, &#8217;tis I!&#8221; And forth
from the dark corner of the shop stepped the soldier,
and then the widow with the little child, and then the
old apple-woman and the lad with the apple. All smiled
and vanished. But the heart of the cobbler was glad,
and he saw at the top of the Gospel page these words:
&#8220;I was an hungered and thirsty, and ye gave me drink;
I was a stranger, and ye took me in.&#8221; And at the bottom
of the page he read: &#8220;Inasmuch as ye have done it
to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
it unto me.&#8221; Then the cobbler saw that the Lord had
really come to him and he had really received Him that
day.&mdash;<i>Adapted from Count Tolstoy.</i></p>


<h4>7. THE PIED PIPER</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Written by Robert Browning, the poet, for the amusement
of a friend&#8217;s son who was ill, and to give
him subjects for drawings.</i>)</p>

<p>Long ago in a country far away there was a town that
was troubled with rats. These rats fought the dogs and
killed the cats and bit the babies in their cradles. They
ate up all the cheese. Yes, and often a man would find a
rat&#8217;s nest in his Sunday hat. The people began to think
they would have to move out and let the rats have the
town. At last the Mayor and Council met to see if they
could think of a way to get rid of them. They had
almost given up when they heard a rap at the door.
&#8220;Come in,&#8221; they said; and there stood a strange, tall,
thin man, with a queer long coat, half yellow and half
red, that came down to his heels, and a pipe upon which
he played. &#8220;My friends,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I see you have a
great many rats in your town. If I can rid you of them,
will you give me a thousand guilders?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, fifty,&#8221;
they cried; &#8220;only take away the rats!&#8221; Then Pied Piper
stepped out into the street and began to blow on his pipe.
Before he had played three notes, out of the houses the
rats came tumbling&mdash;great rats, small rats, lean rats,
fat rats, black rats, gray rats, brown rats, all following
the Piper as if for their very lives. Straight to the river
he walked, drawing the rats after him. In they plunged
head first, and were all drowned. How the bells rang
for joy! How the people shouted! The Mayor gave
orders to poke out all the nests and fill up the holes.
&#8220;First, if you please, my thousand guilders,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Piper. The Mayor and Council laughed: &#8220;Now the rats
are dead, they won&#8217;t come back to life, you know. It
was only a joke we spoke. We won&#8217;t give you more than
fifty guilders.&#8221; Pied Piper threatened, but the Mayor
said, &#8220;Do your worst. Blow your pipe till you burst.&#8221;
Then the Piper stepped into the street again and played
three notes, and at once all the children of the town came
running, tripping, skipping, shouting merrily after the
Piper and his wonderful music. When they reached
the mountainside a great door suddenly opened and all
the children went in with the Piper&mdash;all except one poor
little lame boy who could not keep up, and came too
late. And the door was shut. No one ever heard of
the Piper or the children again. But the Mayor and
Council agreed that when they owed any one anything
after that they would pay it. And these words were
kept in the town where all could see them: &#8220;Always keep
your promise!&#8221;</p>


<h4>8. DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT</h4>

<p>Once there was a little boy named Dick Whittington,
whose father and mother died and the people who took
care of him were very poor. Often he had no breakfast
or dinner. In the town where he lived Dick often heard
about London, the great city, where people said nobody
was ever hungry, nobody had to work, and the streets
were paved with gold. Dick longed to go there. So one
day when a big wagon, drawn by eight horses, all with
bells on their heads, was going to London, Dick went
along. But he was disappointed to find the streets covered
with dirt instead of gold, and none would give the
hungry boy even a crust of dry bread. At night he was
so cold and tired he sat down on the stone steps of a
great house and longed to be back in the town where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
was born. Next day Dick found some work to do in the
kitchen of this great house. He would have been happy
there, but the cook beat him, and the rats and mice in
the garret where he slept kept him awake at night, often
running over his face. One day a gentleman gave him a
penny. Dick bought a cat, which soon drove away all
the rats and mice, and then the poor boy slept soundly
every night.</p>

<p>Dick&#8217;s master was a rich merchant with great ships
that he used to fill with all kinds of things to send to
foreign lands. Whenever a ship was ready to sail it was
his custom to call together all his servants and ask them
to send something in the ship to trade for profit. So one
day when the ship was ready, all the servants had something
to send, except Dick, who said he had nothing
in the world but a cat. &#8220;Send your cat, my lad,&#8221; said
the master; &#8220;perhaps you will get something of profit for
her.&#8221; Dick, with tears in his eyes, carried poor puss
down to the ship and gave her to the captain. After the
cat was gone the rats and mice came back and the cook
treated Dick so cruelly that early one morning he ran
away. He had not gone very far when he sat down
on a stone to rest, and listened to the ringing of a merry
chime of bells, which seemed to him to say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Turn again, Whittington!</div>
<div class="verse">Turn again, Whittington!</div>
<div class="verse">Thrice Lord Mayor of London!</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;If I am to be Lord Mayor of London,&#8221; said Dick,
&#8220;I will go back and let the cook scold me as much as
she pleases.&#8221; Then Dick turned back and reached the
kitchen before any one missed him. Some time after that
the ship came back, and the captain said Dick&#8217;s cat had
won him a great fortune, for an African chief had bought
the cat at a great price to drive away the rats and mice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
from the dining-table of his palace. Dick was cleaning
pots in the kitchen when his master called him into his
office. &#8220;Mr. Whittington,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your cat has
brought you more money than I have in the whole world.&#8221;
Dick was too kind to keep all for himself. He gave presents
to his master&#8217;s daughter Alice, and to the captain,
and to the sailors, and even to the cross old cook. When
he was dressed in a nice suit of clothes he looked as handsome
as any young man in London. So Dick Whittington,
through his cat, became a rich merchant, married
his master&#8217;s daughter, and became three times Lord
Mayor of London.</p>


<h4>9. THE BOY WHO HATED TREES</h4>

<p>One night Dick was told by his father to rise early the
next morning and help set out some new trees. &#8220;I hate
trees,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;I want to go fishing. I wish I lived
in a land where there were no trees!&#8221; Then Dick fell
asleep, and in his dream he heard the queerest rustling
noise, and then a voice called out, &#8220;Here is a boy who
hates trees!&#8221; A procession of trees came toward him.
The willow was weeping; the poplar was trembling; the
aspen was quaking; the pine and elm and maple and
oak were followed by the fruit trees, like the apple and
pear and cherry, while the walnut and birch and palm
slowly brought up the rear. When all was quiet the Pine
began: &#8220;Here is a boy that hates trees, and says we are
of no use!&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Maple, &#8220;and this morning
he ate some of my sugar.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Willow,
&#8220;and he made a whistle out of me.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the
Palm, &#8220;and he fanned himself with one of my leaves.&#8221;
&#8220;And he got his bicycle tire out of me, and his rubber
boots too,&#8221; said another tree. The Elm said: &#8220;I have
a plan. The wind will help us. The wind is our friend.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
So the wind took Dick and hurled him off to a great
desert and dropped him down in a land where there were
no trees. Dick felt very lonely and was full of fright
when he saw a bear coming toward him in the distance,
and there was no tree to climb. How glad he was that
he was mistaken and that it was not a bear coming, but
camels, with men on them. The men beckoned him to
get up and ride, which he was glad to do. Soon he saw
the men bowing down and thanking God and then waving
their hands. Dick looked and saw a spot of green grass,
a spring of cool water, and one of the things he hated&mdash;a
tree. He thought he had never seen anything so beautiful
in all his life. He tumbled off the camel, ran
toward the tree, and threw his arms about it, saying,
&#8220;Dear tree, dear tree!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning Dick was glad to help his father
plant the trees, and the school-teacher on Arbor Day
said, &#8220;I think if good care will help the trees, they will
get it from Dick.&#8221;</p>


<h4>10. THE PRINCE WHO HATED SPIDERS AND FLIES</h4>

<p>A young Prince in a rage once said, &#8220;I wish all the
spiders and flies were driven out of the world!&#8221; Not
long after that he had to hide at the close of a great
battle in a wood, where he fell asleep under a tree. A
soldier found him there, and was about to kill him, when
a fly tickled the Prince&#8217;s face, which awoke him, and
made the soldier run away. That same night the Prince
hid himself in a cave across the mouth of which a spider
wove a web. Next morning two soldiers seeking him
were about to enter the cave when they saw the spider&#8217;s
web. &#8220;He can&#8217;t be in there,&#8221; they said, and passed
on. So a hated fly and a spider, after all, saved the
Prince&#8217;s life!</p>

<h4>11. TIRED OF BEING A LITTLE GIRL</h4>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me,&#8221; sighed a little girl one fine morning,
&#8220;I wish I could be something else!&#8221; &#8220;What would you
like to be?&#8221; said a little voice. &#8220;I would like to be a
rosebud,&#8221; she said. In a moment she felt her skirts
twisting about her body, and when she touched her pink
dress it was not calico but rose-leaves. She looked at
her feet and they had turned green. So she knew she
was a rosebud, growing on a bush in a garden. The
wind swung her back and forth. It was so nice to be a
rosebud. Suddenly a beautiful Fairy bent over and said,
&#8220;I will drink the dew and eat the tender leaves of the
rosebud for dinner.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t,&#8221; cried the little girl,
&#8220;if you do you will eat my head.&#8221; The Fairy began to
laugh. &#8220;Please, make me something else, quick,&#8221; cried
the little girl; &#8220;make me into a bird.&#8221; In a minute she
was a real, live bird hopping around among the daisies.
&#8220;This is great fun,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;but I begin to feel
hungry.&#8221; &#8220;Do you?&#8221; said a little voice; &#8220;then I&#8217;ll feed
you.&#8221; In front of her stood the ugliest little man, holding
in his hand a slimy worm, which he wanted to put
into her mouth. She screamed out, &#8220;I won&#8217;t eat that
worm! I&#8217;m not a real bird! I&#8217;m a&mdash;I&#8217;m a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Just
then she awoke and found she had been dreaming under
the apple tree. Then she ran as fast as she could into the
house, and cried, &#8220;O mamma, I&#8217;d rather be a little girl
than anything else.&#8221;</p>


<h4>12. THE ELEPHANT AND THE TAILOR</h4>

<p>One day a tailor was sitting with his feet crossed by
an open window, making some fine clothes, when an
elephant, passing down to the river, playfully put his
trunk in at the window. The tailor, out of meanness,
pricked the elephant&#8217;s trunk with his sharp needle. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
elephant in pain quickly drew it back and jogged on his
way to the riverside, where, after quenching his thirst, he
filled his trunk and mouth with the muddiest water he
could find, and went back to the tailor&#8217;s window and
squirted it all over him and his fine clothes, making him
a laughing-stock to all his neighbors.</p>


<h4>13. THE LOST CAMEL</h4>

<p>A wise man of the East once met a company of merchants
who had lost their camel in the desert. &#8220;Was the
camel blind in his right eye, and lame in his left foot?&#8221;
asked the man. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Had he lost a front
tooth?&#8221; &#8220;He had.&#8221; &#8220;And was he loaded with wheat
on one side and with honey on the other?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221;
&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen your camel.&#8221;
The merchants were angry and said: &#8220;You must have
seen him, because you know all about him. You have
taken our jewels and money from his load.&#8221; They seized
the man and brought him to the judge, who heard the
story. The judge, as well as the merchants, thought the
man knew more about the camel than he wished to tell.
&#8220;How did you know the camel was blind in one eye?&#8221;
asked the judge. &#8220;I knew the camel was blind in one
eye because it had eaten the grass on only one side of
the path.&#8221; &#8220;How did you know it was lame in its left
leg?&#8221; &#8220;Because I saw that the print of that foot was
fainter.&#8221; &#8220;How did you know he had lost a tooth?&#8221;
&#8220;Because wherever it had grazed a small tuft of grass
was left untouched in the center of the bunch.&#8221; &#8220;But
how could you tell what its load was?&#8221; cried the merchants;
&#8220;tell us that.&#8221; &#8220;The busy ants on one side and
the flies on the other showed me the camel was loaded
with wheat and honey, and I knew it had strayed because
there were no footprints before or behind.&#8221; &#8220;Go,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
said the judge, &#8220;look for your camel.&#8221; The merchants
did so, and found the beast not far away.</p>


<h4>14. THE STORY WITHOUT AN END</h4>

<p>Once a King who never tired of hearing stories said:
&#8220;If any one can tell me a story that will last forever, I
will give him my daughter and half my kingdom, but if
he fails he shall have his head cut off.&#8221; The King&#8217;s
daughter was very pretty, so many young men tried;
but a week, a month, two or three months was all they
could spin out their story, and off came their heads. At
last a young man came who said, &#8220;I can tell a story that
will last forever.&#8221; The King and his daughter begged
him not to try, for they did not want to see another fine
fellow lose his head. But he insisted that he would not
fail, and so began his story: &#8220;Once upon a time a king
built a high granary, and filled it with wheat to the
very top. But in building it the workmen had left a
very little hole near the ground, just large enough to
let one little ant through. So a little ant went in and
carried off a grain of wheat, then another little ant
went in and carried off another grain of wheat, then
another little ant went in and carried off another grain
of wheat.&#8221; Day after day, week after week, the story-teller
kept saying, &#8220;Then another little ant went in and
carried off another grain of wheat.&#8221; &#8220;Tell us what happened
after that?&#8221; pleaded the King. &#8220;O King, I must
first tell you this,&#8221; he said; and so he continued several
weeks longer. At last the King cried; &#8220;Man! Man! you
will drive me wild with your ants. Take my daughter;
be my heir; rule my kingdom; but let me hear no more
of your abominable ants.&#8221; So the man married the King&#8217;s
daughter, and they lived happily. But the King never
cared to hear any more stories.</p>

CHRISTMAS STORIES</h3></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Adapted for Children, Six to Twelve Years.</i>)</p>


<h4>1. SAINT CHRISTOPHER</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Once</span> there was a very strong man who could carry
such heavy loads that he was called &#8220;Offero,&#8221;
meaning &#8220;The Bearer.&#8221; He was very proud of his
strength and said, &#8220;I will serve only the greatest king
on earth.&#8221; He found a rich and powerful king and
served him, until one day he saw his master tremble.
&#8220;Why do you tremble, O king?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Because
I fear Satan, who is too strong for me.&#8221; &#8220;Then I will
serve him,&#8221; said Offero. He went at once and served
Satan, until one day he noticed his new master tremble
before a cross, the cross on which Christ hung to overcome
the strength of Satan. Then Offero went everywhere
in search of the stronger master, Christ. He
found a boy who said: &#8220;Yes, Christ is the strongest King
on earth or in heaven. But to find him you must cross
a broad river whose current is so swift that men are
drowned in trying to cross. If you serve Christ by
carrying over on your strong shoulders the weak and the
little ones, you shall find the Christ of your search on
the other side.&#8221; Offero built a hut beside the swift-flowing
river, and whenever he saw a poor traveler trying
to cross the stream, he bore him on his strong shoulders.
Well was he named &#8220;The Bearer,&#8221; for he carried
many across, and not one was lost. His staff was a
great palm tree which he had plucked up by the roots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
One night as he was resting in his hut he heard the cry
of a little child, calling, &#8220;Offero, will you carry me over
this night?&#8221; A weak little child stood near the river.
Offero helped him on his strong shoulders and, staff in
hand, began to cross the flood. But the wind blew furiously,
the waves rose high, and there was a roaring in
his ears as if a great ocean were let loose. The weight
upon his shoulders bore him down until he feared he
would sink. But he held firmly to his strong staff and
at last reached the other bank and placed the child safely
on the ground. &#8220;What have I borne?&#8221; cried Offero; &#8220;it
could not have been simply a young child, for the weight
was too great!&#8221; Just then the child suddenly changed
into the form of the strong Christ-King, who said:
&#8220;Offero, as thou didst wish to serve me, I accepted thee
as my servant. Thou hast borne, not the weight of a
child, but the weight of a world. Thou shalt be called
&#8216;Christ-Offer&mdash;the Christ-Bearer,&#8217; and shalt serve me
always. Plant thy staff in the ground, and it shall put
forth leaves and fruit.&#8221; Christopher did so, and the dry
staff flourished as the palm tree, and was covered with
clusters of fruit; but the Christ-Child had vanished from
his sight.</p>

<h4>2. THE FIR TREE</h4>

<p>Far away in the forest grew a little Fir Tree. Around
him stood tall pines and firs so large that the little Fir felt
very discontented, wishing so much to be like the other
trees. &#8220;If I were tall like them,&#8221; sighed the Fir, &#8220;I would
spread my branches so far the birds would build their
nests in my boughs, and when the wind blew, I should
bow grandly like them.&#8221; So unhappy was the little tree
that he took no pleasure in the warm sunshine, the birds,
or the bright clouds. One day in winter when the snow
was on the ground, a little rabbit jumped right over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
little tree&#8217;s head. Oh, that made him so angry! Two
years after, the wood-cutters came and cut down several
of the largest trees and carried them away. &#8220;Where do
they take these trees?&#8221; the Fir Tree said; and a stork
replied: &#8220;As I was flying here from Egypt I saw great
masts on the ships. That is what large trees become.&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, how I wish I were tall enough to be a mast and
sail on the sea!&#8221; sighed the Fir Tree.</p>

<p>Christmastime came, and many young trees were cut
down, some that were even smaller than the Fir Tree, and
men carried them away in wagons. &#8220;Where do they
take those trees?&#8221; the Fir Tree asked; and the sparrows
chirped: &#8220;We know! we know! We peeped in at the
windows in the town and saw little trees like those
planted in the middle of a warm room, and made beautiful
with gilded apples, gingerbread, toys, and a hundred
lights.&#8221; &#8220;I wonder if anything like that will ever happen
to me?&#8221; cried the discontented Fir Tree; &#8220;that
would be better than crossing the sea. Oh, when will
Christmas come?&#8221; The wind and air and sun and birds
tried to make the Fir Tree happy, but he only grew more
discontented with his lot. One day, just before Christmas,
the wood-cutter came again, and this time the Fir
Tree was the first to be cut down and carried off. But
he could not think of happiness now, for he was sad at
leaving his home in the forest. He knew that he would
never again see his dear old friends, the trees, the bushes,
the birds, and the flowers. That morning the Fir Tree
was stuck upright in a tub that stood on a rich carpet
in a splendid parlor. Some ladies came in and began
to dress his boughs with very pretty things&mdash;sugar-plums,
apples, oranges, walnuts, dolls; red, blue, and white
candles; and to the top was fastened a glittering golden
star that shone as brightly as any star in the sky.
The tree looked very beautiful. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; sighed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
tree, &#8220;I wish all the candles were lighted! Will the
trees of the forest come to see me? Will the sparrows
peep in at the windows? I wonder if I shall stay pretty
like this always?&#8221; At last the candles were lighted; the
folding doors opened; happy children trooped into the
room shouting and dancing with joy at the sight of the
wonderful Christmas tree. Older people came too, to
look at the sight and enjoy the presents which were taken
one after the other from the tree, until all the candles
were burned low and put out and only the glittering star
remained. The happy children danced about the room
with their pretty toys, and no one cared for the tree or
looked at him except the nurse, who peeped among his
branches to see if an apple or a fig had been forgotten.
All night the tree stood in darkness. In the morning
the servants dragged the tree from the tub and placed
him upstairs in the dark attic, where he stayed all winter,
hidden away from sight and forgotten by every one. In
the spring the tree was carried down-stairs and taken out
into the yard. &#8220;Now I shall live again,&#8221; said the Fir
Tree, and he spread out his branches. But alas! his
leaves were all withered and yellow, yet the star of gold
still hung in the top, glittering in the sunshine. A boy
seeing the star ran up and pulled it off the tree. &#8220;Look
what was sticking to this ugly old Christmas tree,&#8221; he
cried, trampling on the branches until they cracked under
his feet. A few minutes later the gardeners boy came up
with an axe and chopped the tree into small pieces and
threw them into the fire. And just as he was dying, the
Fir Tree saw the little boy wearing the star on his
breast and sighed, &#8220;The night I was crowned with that
beautiful golden star was the happiest night of my life.&#8221;
And he knew that night of happiness was the longed-for
Christmas Eve.&mdash;<i>Adapted from Hans Christian
Andersen.</i></p>

<h4>3. THE CHRISTMAS GIFT</h4>

<p>Once in the sunny land of France there was a little
girl named Piccola, who lived all alone with her mother.
They were very poor, and little Piccola had no dolls or
toys, and she was often hungry and cold. One day when
her mother was ill, Piccola worked hard all day trying to
sell the stockings which she knit, while her own little
bare feet were blue with cold. As Christmas drew near
she said to her mother: &#8220;I wonder what Saint Nicholas
will bring me this year? I have no stocking to hang in
the fireplace, but I shall put my wooden shoe on the
hearth for him. He will not forget me, I am sure.&#8221;
&#8220;Do not think of it this year, my dear child,&#8221; replied her
mother; &#8220;we should be glad if we have bread enough
to eat.&#8221; But Piccola could not believe she would be forgotten.
On Christmas Eve she put her little wooden
shoe on the hearth before the fire and went to sleep to
dream of good Saint Nicholas. The poor mother looked
at the shoe and thought how disappointed the little girl
would be to find it empty in the morning, and sighed to
think she had nothing to put in it. When the morning
dawned Piccola awoke and ran to her shoe, and there in
it lay something with bright eyes looking up at her. A
little swallow, cold and hungry, had flown into the
chimney and down to the room and had crept into the
shoe for warmth. Piccola danced for joy, and clasped
the shivering swallow to her breast. &#8220;Look! Look!&#8221; she
said to her mother. &#8220;A Christmas gift, a gift from the
good Saint Nicholas!&#8221; and she danced again in her little
bare feet. Then she fed and warmed the little bird, and
cared for it tenderly all winter long. In the spring she
opened the window for it to fly away, but it lived in the
woods near-by, and sang often at her door.&mdash;<i>Adapted

<h4>4. THE GOLDEN COBWEBS</h4>

<p class="center">(A story to be told by the Christmas tree)</p>

<p>The night before Christmas the tree was all trimmed
with pop-corn, and silver nuts, and golden apples, and
oranges, and walnuts, and dolls, and bonbons, and a hundred
colored candles. It was placed safely out of sight
in a locked room where the children could not see it until
the proper time. But ever so many other little house-folks
had seen it. Pussy saw it with her great gray
eyes. The house-dog saw it with his steady brown eyes.
The yellow canary saw it with his wise bright eyes. Even
the little mice had a good peek at it. But there was
some one who had not seen the Christmas tree. It was
the little gray spider! The housemother had swept and
dusted and scrubbed to make everything clean for the
Christ-Child&#8217;s birthday and every spider had scampered
away. At last the little gray spider went to the Christ-Child,
and said: &#8220;All the others see the Christmas tree,
dear Christ-Child, but we are cleaned up! We like to
see beautiful things too!&#8221; The Christ-Child was sorry
for the little spider, and he said, &#8220;You shall see it.&#8221; So
on Christmas morning before any of the children were
awake, the spiders came creeping, creeping, creeping
down the attic stairs, along the hall, under the door, and
into the room where the Christmas tree was standing.
Oh! it was beautiful to their little eyes as they looked
upon it as much as they liked. Then father spider,
mother spider, and all the spider family went creeping,
creeping, creeping up the tree and all over its branches,
and in great joy hurried back to their home in the attic.
The Christ-Child looked down to see if the tree was all
ready for the children, and oh!&mdash;it was all covered over
with cobwebs! &#8220;How badly the housewife will feel at
seeing those cobwebs!&#8221; said the Christ-Child. &#8220;I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
change them into golden cobwebs for the beauty of the
Christmas tree.&#8221; So that is how the Christmas tree came
to have golden cobwebs.&mdash;<i>Adapted from &#8220;How to Tell
Stories to Children,&#8221; by Sara Cone Bryant.</i></p>


<h4>5. THE LEGEND OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE</h4>

<p>One cold, wintry night, two little children were sitting
by the fire when suddenly they heard a timid knock at
the door. One of the children ran quickly and opened it.
Outside in the cold and darkness, they saw a poor little
boy, shivering, without shoes on his feet, and dressed in
thin, ragged clothing. &#8220;Please, may I come in and warm
myself?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; cried the children, &#8220;you
shall have our place by the fire. Come in!&#8221; The little
stranger boy came in and the kind children shared their
supper with him and gave him their bed, while they slept
on the hard bench. In the night they were awakened by
strains of sweetest music, and, looking out of the window,
they saw a band of children in shining garments
coming near the house. They were playing on golden
harps, and the air was full of Christmas music. Then
lo! the Stranger-child, no longer in rags, but clad in
silvery light, stood before them, and in his soft voice
said: &#8220;I was cold and you let me in. I was hungry and
you fed me. I was very tired and you gave me your
nice soft bed. I am the Christ-Child who comes to bring
peace and happiness to all kind children. As you have
been good to me, may this tree every year bring rich
gifts to you.&#8221; He broke a branch from the fir tree that
grew near the door and planted it in the ground, and disappeared.
But the branch grew into the Tree of Love,
and every year it bore golden fruit for the kind children.&mdash;<i>Adapted

<h4>1. HOW THE WORLD WAS MADE</h4>

<p class="center">(Genesis 1, 2)</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the beginning, long, long ago, God created this wonderful
world and all things in it. At first there was
no earth, no sun, no moon or stars, no grass or trees,
no seas or sky. This great round ball, on which we live,
was nothing but a great cloud of mist without shape or
size. Everywhere there was great darkness. God was
living in his home in heaven, and he said, &#8220;Let there be
light.&#8221; So light was the first wonderful thing God made.
Then God separated the sky mists from the earth mists.
He made the waters roll back into seas; and the mountains,
with great lakes between, appeared. When the sun
and moon and stars shone out more brightly, driving the
mists and water away from the dry land, God made grass
and trees and flowers to spring up in great beauty and
abundance; and each tree and flower had little, tiny seeds
to send up little shoots to make others. Then great swarms
of living things appeared&mdash;strange fishes and sea-monsters
to swim in the waters, reptiles and creeping things
to creep on the land, birds to fly through the air, and
all kinds of four-footed beasts to roam through the
forests. Still, there was no man nor woman, nor any
little child anywhere to enjoy what God had made. So
God created a man and called his name Adam. God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
placed him in a large garden called Eden, filled with
beautiful and useful things&mdash;rivers of water to water it,
gold and precious stones, trees good for food, animals,
birds, and fishes. Adam gave names to all the animals.
But among them all there was not one to talk with
him. So God made a beautiful companion for Adam and
called her name Eve. This first man and woman lived
together very happily in this beautiful Garden of Eden,
caring for the flowers and fruit, watching the animals,
loving each other, and talking with God, their Creator
and Friend.</p>


<h4>2. HOW A HAPPY HOME WAS LOST</h4>

<p class="center">(Genesis 3)</p>

<p>Adam and Eve were very happy in their beautiful
garden-home in Eden. In the cool of the day, when the
sun went down, and the garden was quiet, they knew that
God was very, very near them, walking and talking with
them. All the animals and plants, all the beautiful trees
were for their use. But there was one tree with fruit
that God, to teach them to obey, told them not to eat.
For a long time they thought of nothing else but doing
exactly what God told them. But one day Eve stopped in
front of the tree and looked at the fruit. How good it
looked! She wondered how it tasted. Then she turned
to go away, for she knew that God had said that whoever
tasted it would die. Just then she heard a voice. She
looked, and the voice came from a bright, shining snake,
coiled close in front of the tree. The snake said, &#8220;Did
God say you shall not eat of any tree of this garden?&#8221;
Eve said, &#8220;God said we shall not eat of this tree, nor
touch it, lest we die.&#8221; &#8220;You will be like God if you
eat it; you will know good and evil.&#8221; She listened to
this voice tempting her to do what was wrong. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
she looked at the tree again. It looked so good to eat
and so pretty, and as if it would make one know a great
deal, that she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then
she ran and gave some to Adam, and he ate it too. That
evening, when the sun was going down, making long
shadows upon the grass, and a cool breeze was rustling
the leaves, and the garden was all lonely and still, Adam
heard the sound of God in the garden. Instead of gladly
running to meet their heavenly Father and Friend, as
they had always done before when he came to talk with
them, they were afraid, and ran and hid themselves among
the trees. God called to Adam, &#8220;Where art thou?&#8221;
Guilty and ashamed, Adam said, &#8220;I heard thy voice,
and I was afraid.&#8221; God said, &#8220;Hast thou eaten of the
tree of which I commanded thee not to eat?&#8221; Adam
said, &#8220;Eve gave it to me and I ate.&#8221; Eve said, &#8220;The
snake tempted me, and I ate.&#8221; God told the snake he
must crawl always flat on the ground, and every animal
and man would hate him more than any other creature.
He told Adam and Eve, because they had disobeyed him,
they must be driven out of the beautiful garden and must
dig and work hard in getting their food in desert lands
among thistles and thorns, stones and timber, and at last,
he said, they must die. But God still loved them, and
gave them a beautiful promise of a loving Saviour who
would be so obedient and pure and strong that he would
prepare for them a beautiful city in the place of their
garden-home, which they had lost through disobedience.</p>


<h4>3. THE FIRST TWO BROTHERS</h4>

<p class="center">(Genesis 4)</p>

<p>The first two brothers in the world were Cain and Abel.
They were born after their parents were driven out of
their beautiful garden-home in Eden. When these boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
grew up, Cain, the elder, became a farmer, and Abel became
a shepherd. Their parents brought them up always
to ask God to forgive them when they did wrong, and
to bring offerings to him of what they had. One day
when they came with their gifts, Abel, with a loving heart,
carried a lamb, the best of his flock, but Cain brought
some fruit in a careless way. God was well pleased
with Abel&#8217;s gift, because of the love that came with it;
but not with Cain&#8217;s, because Cain kept hatred to his
brother in his heart. Cain was angry and his face became
dark and scowling. God said: &#8220;Why are you angry and
scowling? If you do well, will you not be happy? If
you do not well, hatred in your heart will crouch, like a
lion, ready to spring at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Cain paid no attention to God&#8217;s loving word. One
day he said to Abel, &#8220;Come into the field with me.&#8221;
When they were there alone, the crouching lion of hatred
in Cain&#8217;s heart sprang up, and Cain lifted up his hand
and slew his brother. Then Cain heard God&#8217;s voice saying,
&#8220;Where is thy brother?&#8221; He answered untruthfully,
&#8220;I know not; am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221; Then
as Cain had done this wicked deed, God sent him from
his home and parents to become a wanderer on the earth,
working even harder than his father and his mother
did. Cain&#8217;s suffering was just what he had brought upon
himself, yet he said, &#8220;My punishment is greater than I
can bear.&#8221; He was afraid wherever he went men would
seek to kill him, for he knew he deserved to be killed.
But God gave him a mark by which he could know that
God was still watching over him and would not let any
one kill him. So Cain went away and built a city and
lived unhappily the rest of his life, away from his father
and mother, because he had allowed hatred instead of
love to live in his heart, and because he had not tried
to please his loving Father in heaven.</p>

<h4>4. THE FLOOD AND THE RAINBOW</h4>

<p class="center">(Genesis 6-8)</p>

<p>Once when God looked down on the people of the
earth, he saw that there was only one good man to be
found anywhere. All the rest were disobedient and very
wicked. So God planned to save all who would be obedient
to him, but to destroy all the disobedient, in order
that such great wickedness should not increase over all
the earth. God told Noah, the one just and good man,
his plan. He told him to build a large ark, half boat and
half house. It was to be five hundred feet long, fifty
feet high, and eighty-three feet wide&mdash;about the size of
a big ocean steamer to-day. There were to be three
stories, many rooms, and a window on the top. The
one door was to be on the side. This great houseboat
was not to be for travel, but only to float on the water.
In the ark Noah, his wife and sons, and his sons&#8217; wives,
and all others who would obey God, were to be saved.
For one hundred long years Noah and his sons worked
away building this strange ship&mdash;hammering, sawing,
planing, and laying great beams hundreds of feet long.
The people laughed at Noah and mocked him. It was
very hard for Noah to be mocked, but he kept right on
with his work, telling them of God and his holiness and
how their wickedness was grieving God. But they would
not listen, nor change their ways, nor believe any flood
would come. At last the great ark was finished. Then
Noah gathered together two of every kind of birds and
animals, and they marched or flew into the ark, and behind
them Noah and his family went in, with food for
all to last for many months. And God shut the door.
So they were safe because they had obeyed God.</p>

<p>Then the rain began to fall. Thunder crashed and
echoed from the mountains and the wind dashed the rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
against the ark. Torrents of rain came down, until soon
the ark began to float. Higher and higher it rose, rocking
and tossing, up above the treetops, above the hills,
above the mountains. The flood had come, and the
wicked people were all drowned. But Noah and his
family were safe inside the ark. After forty days the
rain stopped, but the water flooded in from the sea.
For one hundred and fifty days the waters rose, and then
began to go down. But the ark rested on one of the high
mountains. Noah opened the window and sent forth a
raven, and then a dove. The raven flew away, resting
on things floating in the water. The dove came back
several times, once bearing an olive-branch in her beak.
At last she did not return, by which Noah knew the dove
had found land on which to rest, and that the water was
gone. Then Noah and all in the ark went out, after being
in it more than a year. The first thing Noah did was to
thank God for saving him and his family. Then Noah
looked up in the clear, blue sky and there was a wonderful
rainbow, with every color in it, arching the heavens.
This was God&#8217;s sign and promise that he would never
again destroy the world with water. So every time they
saw a rainbow after that, they remembered that God was
looking at it too, remembering this promise of his: &#8220;During
all the days of the earth, sowing and reaping, and
cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night,
shall not cease.&#8221;</p>

<h4>5· THE GENEROUS UNCLE AND THE SELFISH NEPHEW</h4>

<p class="center">(Genesis 12-19)</p>

<p>Long, long after the flood, there lived a good man
whose name was Abram, &#8220;the friend of God.&#8221; He was
the first Hebrew. At first he lived in a large city on the
river Euphrates. It was a beautiful city with fine buildings,
gardens, fountains, statuary, and other things for
comfort and pleasure. Abram and his people were rich.
They had everything to make them happy, excepting
one thing. Abram saw that in all that great city, in all
that country, none worshiped God but himself. There
were many temples where the people worshiped the sun,
moon, stars, and many false gods. There were beautiful
temples built, and beautiful music sung to the Sun-god,
but no thanks were given to the great Creator of
the sun and moon and man. A good deal of their worship
was very wicked and cruel, and often boys and girls
were burned to please the idols. Abram saw all this
was false and wicked. One day God told him to leave
that land and take a long journey to another land that
God would show him. At last Abram reached a land so
rich in vines, fruit trees, and pastures for flocks and
herds, that it was called &#8220;the land flowing with milk and
honey.&#8221; Here Abram and Lot, his brother&#8217;s son, lived
in tents. Both were very rich in cattle, goats, sheep,
servants, and silver and gold. But when the servants of
Lot and Abram kept quarreling over which should have
the best pasture for feeding their flocks, Abram said to
Lot: &#8220;Let there be no quarrel between thee and me, and
between our servants, for we are brethren. Choose the
land you wish, and I will take what is left.&#8221; Abram was
older than Lot, and had always been kind and generous,
like a father, to him. Lot should have given his uncle the
first choice. Instead of that, Lot greedily chose the well-watered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
plain-lands near the river Jordan, leaving to his
uncle the hilly land. Abram generously let him keep
them. Lot moved close to the wicked city of Sodom.
Soon after, in a battle, Lot and his family and his servants
were taken prisoners. Lot had not treated his
uncle well, but that made no difference to Abram. He
was a true friend, loving Lot even when he did not do
right. So he rescued Lot and saved all the property the
kings had stolen. Lot went back to Sodom, making his
home this time inside the city, among its wicked people,
and he grew more forgetful of God.</p>

<p>One day, in Sodom and Gomorrah, the cities of the
plain, a great fire broke out which destroyed everything
Lot had. Only for Abram&#8217;s prayer to God, Lot would
have been burned up too. But for Abram&#8217;s sake, two
angels came and led Lot and his wife and two daughters
out of the city, telling them not to look back nor stay
in all the plain, but flee to the mountains. Lot&#8217;s wife
looked longingly back at the wicked cities, and was
changed into a pillar of salt in the very plain upon
which she, with Lot, had so much set her heart. Lot and
his two daughters were saved only by fleeing to the mountain
land that Lot had despised and Abram had taken.
So, after all, the selfish nephew did not choose so well
as the unselfish uncle, &#8220;the friend of God.&#8221;</p>

<h4>6. THE OBLIGING GIRL AT THE WELL</h4>

<p class="center">(Genesis 24)</p>

<p>&#8220;Laughter&#8221; is a queer name for a boy. But
&#8220;Laughter&#8221; is the name Abraham gave his son. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
is what Isaac means. When Isaac grew up Abraham did
not like the idea of his son marrying any of the young
women of that land because they all worshiped idols;
so he called his head servant and told him to go far
away to the country where Abraham&#8217;s own people lived,
and there find a young woman who would be the right
sort of wife for Isaac. It was a long, long journey
across the desert. Abraham gave the servant ten camels,
and servants, and tents, with gold and silver, and precious
stones and rich robes, to give as presents to the young
woman and her family. After many days of travel the
servant came to a city where some of Abraham&#8217;s people
were still living. Outside the city was a well with a
trough for the camels to drink from. He knew every
evening young girls and women came with their pitchers
for drinking water to this well. He decided when they
came he would ask for a drink, and whoever gave him
a drink and also offered to give the camels a drink by
filling the watering-trough, would prove the wife for
Isaac. He also prayed God to guide him. While he was
praying there came to the well a beautiful young girl
carrying a pitcher on her shoulder. When she had filled
her pitcher the servant said, &#8220;Let me drink, please.&#8221;
She said, &#8220;Drink, my lord,&#8221; and quickly let down her
pitcher upon her hand and gave him a drink. Then seeing
how tired the camels looked, her kind heart made her
say, &#8220;I will get water for your camels too.&#8221; Camels
drink a great deal of water, and there were ten of them,
but this obliging girl did not stop filling the large watering-trough
until every thirsty beast had drunk enough.
Quietly the servant watched her, and when he saw how
friendly she was he gave her a splendid gold earring and
two beautiful bracelets of gold and asked her name and
whether there was room in her father&#8217;s house for him to
stay over night. She told him her name was Rebecca&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
relative of Abraham&#8217;s family&mdash;and said there was plenty
of room for them to spend the night. Then the servant
thanked God, for he knew this kind, obliging girl was
just the one whom God wanted to become Isaac&#8217;s wife.
When they came to the house, the servant told his story
to all, and gave still more beautiful presents to Rebecca
and to her sister and brothers. Early the next morning
the old servant wanted to start back at once, because
God had prospered his journey. They called Rebecca
and said to her, &#8220;Wilt thou go with this man?&#8221; And
she said, &#8220;I will go.&#8221; So Rebecca&#8217;s queer bridal party,
herself and her old nurse, Deborah, and several maids,
mounted on camels and escorted by Abraham&#8217;s servants,
began the long march to Isaac&#8217;s home in Canaan where
she and Isaac were married. They loved each other dearly.
And Abraham was glad that &#8220;Laughter&#8221; had found
so good and true a wife in the friendly girl at the well.</p>


<h4>7. THE LADDER THAT REACHED TO HEAVEN</h4>

<p class="center">(Genesis 28)</p>

<p>Isaac and Rebecca had two boys, Esau and Jacob.
Esau became a hunter, and Jacob a shepherd. One day
Esau came home from hunting very hungry. He asked
Jacob to give him some of the red broth that he had
just cooked. Jacob knew that Esau cared nothing for
his birthright (that is, all that he would receive as the
eldest son). But Jacob wanted that more than anything
else in the world. So Jacob said, &#8220;Will you give me
your birthright if I do?&#8221; Esau said, &#8220;Yes, I am starving;
give me the broth for the blessing.&#8221; Jacob could
not believe Esau meant it; but he did mean it, and so
sold his birthright for something to eat. Not long after,
Jacob received the birthright blessing from his father,
Isaac. Then Esau was sorry and angry, and hated his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
brother, and planned to kill him. Rebecca told Jacob
what Esau was planning to do, and sent him to her
brother&#8217;s home to save Jacob&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>So Jacob had to leave his father and mother and home
and start alone on a long journey with nothing but a
long cloak to wrap about him at night. When the sun
went down, as he was thinking of the great wrong he
had done his brother, tired and sad at heart, he lay down
to sleep on a stony hillside, placing one of the stones
under his head for a pillow. At last he fell asleep, and
in his dream he saw a ladder reaching from earth to
heaven. He saw beautiful shining angels coming down
the ladder and going back. At the top he saw God looking
down on him, saying, &#8220;I am the Lord, the God of
Abraham and thy father Isaac.&#8221; God promised if he
would do what was right, that he would forgive all
his wrong&mdash;be with him in all his journey and give him
the wonderful promises made to Abraham and Isaac.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, when Jacob awoke, he knelt beside
that stone, promising God that he would be a better
man. He lived to be an aged man&mdash;one hundred and
forty-seven years old&mdash;but he never forgot that place
which he called &#8220;The House of God,&#8221; from which he
saw the ladder that reached to heaven, showing him that
God was near him.</p>

<p>From this story the beautiful lines of the hymn,
which have been such a comfort to many upon battlefields
and in the hour of death, were written:</p>

<h4>8. THE SLAVE-BOY WHO BECAME A PRINCE</h4>

<p class="center">(Genesis 37 to 47)</p>

<p>Jacob had twelve sons, and Joseph was next to the
youngest. He was the best loved of all, and his father
showed how much he loved him by giving him a coat of
many colors. This made his older brothers jealous and
angry. When Joseph was sixteen years old he dreamed
that he was binding sheaves of grain in a field with his
eleven brothers and his father and mother, and all the
other sheaves bowed down to his sheaf. Another dream
he had was that the sun and moon and eleven stars
bowed down to him. When Joseph awoke he told these
queer dreams to his brothers. No wonder they called
him &#8220;the dreamer&#8221; and teasingly said, &#8220;Shall we all,
indeed, come to bow down to you?&#8221; Soon after this
his nine big brothers caught this boy out in a field and put
him down into a deep pit, and then sold him to camel-drivers
as a slave for twenty pieces of silver (about one
hundred and twenty dollars). Then they killed one of
their own goats, dipped Joseph&#8217;s coat of many colors,
which they had taken off him, into the blood, and taking
it home, wickedly made their father think a wild beast
had eaten Joseph. Jacob mourned for him as dead, and
the brothers thought the dreamer would never tell any
more of his dreams.</p>

<p>The camel-drivers sold Joseph as a slave in Egypt to a
rich man who promoted him to be the chief ruler of his
great house. It was a fine place for him. But one day
some one told a very wicked lie about him, and he was
cast into prison. But Joseph was so cheerful and kind
and useful, even in prison, that he was soon placed over
all the prisoners. When the king heard that Joseph had
power to tell people the meaning of their dreams, he sent
for him to tell the meaning of two dreams that troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
him. Joseph told the king his dreams. So Joseph was
removed from prison to the king&#8217;s palace, and was dressed
in fine clothes, with a gold chain around his neck and a
gold ring on his finger, and made ruler over all the land,
next to the king. Soon a great famine arose (just as
Joseph had told the king) in all lands except Egypt, because
Joseph had filled big barns with corn. Joseph&#8217;s ten
brothers came from Canaan to Egypt to buy food to
keep their families from starving. They were taken into
the presence of the great ruler who sold the corn, and
they bowed down to the earth before him. So the dreamer&#8217;s
dream came true, though they did not know it then.
Joseph knew them, and treated them kindly without letting
them know he was their brother. He longed to see
his youngest brother, Benjamin, and told the older
brothers to bring him down with them when they came
again, or they could have no more corn. When they
brought him, and when Joseph looked upon Benjamin&#8217;s
face, this great Prince of Egypt burst into tears and said,
&#8220;I am Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt,
but whom God sent before you to preserve life.&#8221; Then
they were afraid, but Joseph lovingly put his arms
about their necks and kissed them and cried with them
until they knew that he freely forgave them. So they
went home quickly and brought their old father, Jacob,
the good news, &#8220;Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over
all the land of Egypt!&#8221; Jacob could scarcely believe
them. But when they told him how he had forgiven their
wickedness, he said, &#8220;I will go and see him before I die.&#8221;
So all together they went to Egypt and lived in a beautiful
house which Joseph gave them. Then he took good
care of them all, and lived near his dear old father until
the old man died, happily and peacefully, because he was
with his beloved Joseph, whom he had lost as a slave
and had found again as a prince.</p>

<h4>9. THE BABY BROTHER IN A BASKET-BOAT</h4>

<p class="center">(Exodus 2)</p>

<p>Long, long ago, a little boy was born in a Hebrew
home, at a time when a cruel king of Egypt ordered all
Hebrew boys that were born, to be thrown to the crocodiles
in the great river Nile. But this little babe was so
beautiful that his mother hid him in the house and prayed
God to keep him safe. She hid him carefully for three
months. Then, being afraid some one might hear him,
she went to the river and gathered some long, strong
grasses that grew there and braided them together, making
a small basket and shaping it like a boat. To make
it warm and dry inside, and to keep it from sinking
when placed in the water, she painted it with black paint
inside and out. Early one morning, when all was ready,
the mother took her baby boy quietly sleeping in the
basket-boat, and went down to the river Nile, the little
baby&#8217;s sister, Miriam, following closely behind her. The
mother hid the basket among the tall grasses near the
shore, and again prayed God to keep her baby safe.
Miriam was left hiding in the tall grass near-by to see
what would happen to her little brother in his new bed.
Very soon the princess, the daughter of the cruel king
of Egypt, with her maids, came down to the river to
bathe. Quickly she spied the basket-boat and cried,
&#8220;What is that floating on the water among the tall
grasses? Bring it to me.&#8221; One of her maids ran and
picked up the basket and brought it to the princess.
When she opened it, there was the most beautiful baby
boy she had ever seen! The child was wide awake, and
seeing the strange face, began to cry. &#8220;It is one of the
Hebrew babies that my father ordered drowned!&#8221; she
said. &#8220;But I have found him, and I will keep him as my
own little baby boy. I will call his name &#8216;Moses.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Miriam was watching from her hiding-place in the tall
grasses. She ran out and said, &#8220;Shall I bring a nurse
for the baby?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the princess. Miriam ran
home as fast as she could, and whom do you suppose she
brought? The baby&#8217;s own mother! And the princess
told her to take him home and nurse him and care for
him for her, for she loved him as her very own, and the
king would not harm him.</p>

<p>So the prayer that Moses&#8217; mother made to God to take
care of her little baby boy in the basket-boat was answered.
And Moses grew up to be a great and good
man.</p>


<h4>10. WHY BOYS TAKE OFF THEIR HATS IN CHURCH</h4>

<p class="center">(Exodus 3)</p>

<p>When the boy Moses was old enough to leave his
mother he went to live with his new mother in the king&#8217;s
palace.</p>

<p>Moses was a good boy. He studied his lessons so
well in school that he grew up to be one of the wisest
and best young men in all the land. But Moses never
forgot his own Hebrew people. He was not careless of
the cruel way they were treated as slaves by the king&#8217;s
officers. He tried to improve their sad condition in his
own hasty way, but he soon saw that neither his own
people nor their masters wanted a princess&#8217;s son to interfere.
They were both ready to kill him for trying to help.
So Moses had to flee for his life into the mountains where
he became a shepherd. One day as he was leading his
sheep up the mountainside, he saw a thorn-bush all aflame;
and it kept on burning, but was not burned up. Moses
wondered to see so strange a sight. Leaving his sheep
he went near. Suddenly a Voice called out of the midst
of the fire-bush, &#8220;Moses! Moses!&#8221; Moses answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
&#8220;Here am I.&#8221; The Voice said, &#8220;Take off thy shoes
from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is
holy ground,&#8221; It was God, in the form of an angel,
speaking to him. Moses at once took off his shoes and
bowed reverently in the presence of God. Then God told
him a better way by which he could help his downtrodden
people and set them free from their cruel masters who
were beating them and making their life so hard. He
told Moses he wanted him to lead his people out of their
bondage. At first Moses was afraid he was not able to
do what God wanted him to do, but God said, &#8220;Certainly,
Moses, I will be with thee.&#8221; Moses obeyed the Voice
that spoke that day to him out of the fire-bush, and he
became one of the greatest of leaders and lawgivers that
this world ever saw. Men and boys take off their hats
in church to-day for the same reason that Moses removed
his shoes before the fire-bush&mdash;to show reverence in the
presence of God and respect for his wonderful way of
speaking to men.</p>


<h4>II. THE BOY WHO LIVED IN A CHURCH</h4>

<p class="center">(1 Samuel 2, 3)</p>

<p>Once there was a little boy, about seven years old, who
was taken by his mother to a beautiful church and left
there to be educated by the minister, who lived in a room
at the side of the church. The little boy&#8217;s mother had
promised God that if he would give her a little boy she
would give him back to him, and that all the days of his
life her boy should serve him. So as soon as he was old
enough to leave her she remembered her promise. A
little room was fitted up for the little fellow next to the
minister&#8217;s room. Little Samuel learned to trim the
lamps, to open and close the church doors, and to be useful
in many little ways in helping the minister. Once a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
year his mother came to see him, bringing for him a beautiful
little, new, white coat, which she had made for him.
It was the same kind of white coat the minister wore.
One night as the little boy was lying asleep in his room,
suddenly a beautiful Voice rang through the chamber,
calling, &#8220;Samuel! Samuel!&#8221; Samuel thought it was the
minister calling him. He ran to the minister&#8217;s room, saying,
&#8220;Here am I!&#8221; &#8220;I called not,&#8221; said the minister;
&#8220;lie down again.&#8221; So the boy went back to bed. Then
again the Voice called, &#8220;Samuel!&#8221; Again he ran to the
minister who said, &#8220;I called not; lie down again.&#8221; When
all was quiet, the third time the Voice called, &#8220;Samuel!&#8221;
and again the boy sprang up and ran quickly to the
minister&#8217;s room. Then the minister knew God was calling
him. &#8220;Go lie down,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and if you hear the
Voice again, it is God calling you; say, &#8216;Speak, Lord, for
thy servant heareth.&#8217;&#8221; As soon as Samuel lay down
again, God called, &#8220;Samuel! Samuel!&#8221; and little Samuel
kneeling beside his bed said, &#8220;Speak, Lord, for thy servant
heareth.&#8221; Then God told him what he wished him to
do for him when he grew older. So the little boy who
was obedient to God&#8217;s voice grew up to be a great and
good man, living always for the good of his people.</p>


<h4>12. THE DAUGHTER WHO HONORED HER MOTHER</h4>

<p class="center">(Book of Ruth)</p>

<p>Far away in the strange land of Moab a poor widow
started to return to her own home in the land of Israel.
Ruth and Orpah, her two daughters-in-law, the wives of
her sons who had just died, wished to go with her, for
they could not think of the poor, old, sad mother returning
all by herself on that long journey. But after they
had gone a little way, the old mother kissed them and
said, &#8220;Go back to your home and native land!&#8221; So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Orpah kissed her good-bye and returned, but Ruth clung
to her mother-in-law and said: &#8220;Entreat me not to leave
thee and return from following after thee; for whither
thou goest I will go; and where thou lodgest I will lodge;
thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;
where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried.
Nothing but death shall part thee and me.&#8221; Ruth knew
that where Naomi was going she would be poor, and
that they would have to work hard, but she loved this
old mother too much to leave her. Soon they saw the
hills and then the houses of Bethlehem, Naomi&#8217;s home.
They settled down in that little town, but were so poor
they did not know how to get even food enough to eat.
The time of year had come when the farmers were beginning
to cut the barley&mdash;the harvest-time. It was the
custom in that land to allow poor people to go into the
fields and gather up the loose ears of barley that were
left by the reapers; and Ruth went to glean a little food
for herself and her mother. She happened to go into the
field of a rich man named Boaz. By and by when Boaz
came to see how the reapers were getting on, he saw
Ruth gleaning, and asked his reapers who she was. They
told him that she was Naomi&#8217;s daughter-in-law, just come
from Moab. Then Boaz called her to him and told her
that she was welcome to glean in his fields all through the
harvest. He said: &#8220;I have heard all about your goodness
to Naomi. May you be fully rewarded by Jehovah,
the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to
take refuge.&#8221; At dinnertime Boaz told her to sit down
with the reapers, who gave her food and drink. She ate
all she wished, and still she had some left, which in the
evening she took home with her, with the barley she had
gleaned, to Naomi. At the end of the barley harvest,
this great and good rich man, Boaz, fell in love with
Ruth, and she became his wife. The old mother, Naomi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
went to live with them in their large and beautiful house,
and she never was in want again. When a little son
came to them, Ruth called his name Obed, and when he
grew to be an old man, he was the grandfather of King
David. So Ruth, the gleaner, who was kind and loyal to
her mother-in-law, became the great-grandmother of the
greatest King of Israel.</p>

<h4>13. THE SHEPHERD-BOY WHO SLEW A GIANT</h4>

<p>Far away on a hillside, one starry night, a shepherd-boy
was watching his father&#8217;s sheep. The little lambs
were cuddled up close to their mothers and all was quiet
and peaceful in the moonlight when out of the woods
near-by came a dark animal. It was a big brown bear
that had come to steal a lamb. Nearer and nearer it came
when the shepherd-boy, who loved his sheep, quickly
placed a large sharp stone in his sling and slung it at the
bear&#8217;s forehead. With a great cry of pain the bear rolled
over dead. So the lambs were saved from the bear.
Another time, a lion sprang out from behind a rock and,
seizing a little baby lamb in his mouth, started to run
away with it. On the minute the shepherd-boy was after
him, slinging one of his sharp stones at the lion&#8217;s head.
It struck the lion without killing him, but, letting the
baby lamb go, he turned roaring and sprang at the boy.
He caught him by the beard, and with his shepherd&#8217;s
staff struck at him until the great animal fell back dead.
So the lambs loved the shepherd still more, for he had
saved them from the lion too. Some time after, this
same shepherd-boy went out to the battlefield to take
some corn and loaves of bread to his soldier brothers.
While he was talking to his brothers a great giant came
out and stood upon a high cliff and cried across the valley,
&#8220;I dare any man to come and fight me!&#8221; This giant was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
ten and a half feet in height&mdash;so tall that a boy would not
come as high as his knees. Upon his head was a helmet
of brass; his whole body was covered with armor of
brass; even on his legs were heavy plates of brass. In
his hand he held a long staff with a sharp spear-point at
the end; by his side hung a sword, and a man went before
him carrying a shield. This was the famous Philistine
giant, &#8220;Goliath,&#8221; before whom all the Hebrew soldiers
trembled and ran away to their tents in fear. This young
shepherd-boy was surprised that none dared go out and
fight him, especially when he heard that King Saul had
said whoever would kill this terrible giant should receive
great riches and have the king&#8217;s daughter for his wife.
This boy said, &#8220;I will go and fight him!&#8221; Some one
told the king what he said, and Saul sent for him and
said: &#8220;Surely you are not able to go and fight him; you
are only a boy, and he has been a fighter from the time
he was a boy.&#8221; This shepherd-boy bravely replied:
&#8220;When I was smaller than I am now, I was watching my
father&#8217;s sheep, and a bear and a lion came to take a lamb
out of the flock, and I smote both the lion and the bear,
and this giant shall be as one of them, because he has
defied the armies of the living God. My God, who delivered
me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw
of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this
boastful giant.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;My boy, go; and may
God be with you.&#8221; Then he offered the shepherd-boy
his armor of brass, his helmet, and sword. But the shepherd-boy
said, &#8220;Please, may I go without these? My
shepherd&#8217;s sling and staff, with God, are all I need.&#8221;
Then he ran to the brook and selected five smooth stones
and put them in his shepherd&#8217;s bag and went forth to
meet the giant who came to meet him. When Goliath
saw only a boy he said: &#8220;Am I a dog that you come to
me with a stick! Come to me, boy, and I&#8217;ll give your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
flesh to the birds and beasts!&#8221; And he cursed him by
his gods. The brave shepherd-boy did not flinch, but
replied: &#8220;You come to me with a sword, and a spear, and
a javelin. I come to you in the name of the God of the
armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This day God
will deliver you into my hands, and I will take your
head from you and give it to the birds and wild beasts,
that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
and that they may know that God saves not with sword
or spear; for this battle is God&#8217;s, and he will give you
into our hands.&#8221; The proud giant, clad in his brass
armor, began walking toward the boy, who quickly put
his hand into his bag, took out a stone, slung it with all
his might at the giant&#8217;s forehead, and Goliath fell on
his face to the ground&mdash;dead. Quickly he ran, stood on
the giant, took the great sword of Goliath out of its
sheath, and with one blow cut off the giant&#8217;s head in the
sight of the soldiers of both armies. When the army of
the giant saw that their champion was dead, they turned
and ran away over the mountains and, with a shout of
victory, Saul&#8217;s soldiers ran after them and took them
prisoners. So the shepherd-boy, with a sling and a stone,
and the help of God, won a great battle that day. He
became the king&#8217;s son-in-law, and when Saul died he became
king, one of the greatest and best kings Israel ever
had&mdash;King David.</p>


<h4>14. THE ARROW-BOY AND THE TWO FRIENDS</h4>

<p class="center">(1 Samuel 18 to 20)</p>

<p>The shepherd-boy who slew the giant was invited to
live at the king&#8217;s palace, and he became a great friend of
the king&#8217;s son, Jonathan. David and Jonathan soon
loved each other greatly. All the people too came to love
David more than they did King Saul. This made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
king very jealous, and he resolved to kill this popular
young soldier, whom everybody praised so much; even
the women and girls singing of him in the streets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Saul hath slain his thousands,</div>
<div class="verse">And David his ten thousands.</div>
</div></div>

<p>When Jonathan suspected his father&#8217;s evil intentions,
he told David to go away from the palace for three days.
&#8220;After three days,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will come to your hiding-place
and bring an arrow-boy with me, and I will shoot
three arrows. If I say to the boy, &#8216;Run and find the
arrows on this side of you, come back,&#8217; you can come
back to the palace in safety; but if I say, &#8216;Haste, stay not,&#8217;
then there is danger, and you must flee.&#8221; After two days
Saul missed David at the dining-table, and told Jonathan
that if he found David he would surely kill him. And he
threw a javelin at Jonathan to kill him too, because he
was the friend of David. Quickly Jonathan went with
the boy to the place appointed and shot an arrow far
beyond the mark and cried to the boy, &#8220;Haste, stay not.&#8221;
The boy ran and brought him the arrow and returned to
the palace. David came out from his hiding-place. The
two friends kissed each other and made promises of
eternal friendship. And they saw each other only once
after that day. So the arrow-boy helped the two friends.</p>


<h4>15. THE LITTLE LAME PRINCE</h4>

<p class="center">(2 Samuel 4: 4; 9: 1-13)</p>

<p>One afternoon, long ago, a little boy prince five years
old, was playing with his toys in his father&#8217;s palace, and
his nurse was watching him. Suddenly a messenger ran
up to the house and rushed in, bearing the sad news that a
terrible battle had been fought between the Hebrews and
the Philistines in which King Saul and the little prince&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
father, Jonathan, David&#8217;s friend, had been slain. &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;Saul and Jonathan are dead! Flee for your
lives!&#8221; The nurse picked up the little boy in her
arms to carry him away quickly, when, in her haste and
fright, she stumbled and fell. In the fall the little boy&#8217;s
ankles were broken, and ever after he was a helpless
cripple. The little lame prince was hidden away in a
friend&#8217;s house so safely that almost everybody supposed
the Philistine soldiers must have slain him too. A few
years afterward, David said: &#8220;Is there yet any left of
the family of Saul that I may show the kindness of God
to him for Jonathan&#8217;s sake?&#8221; One of the servants said,
&#8220;Jonathan hath yet a son who is lame in both his feet.&#8221;
&#8220;Bring him to me,&#8221; said David; and when he was before
the king, David said: &#8220;Fear not; for I will surely show
kindness to you for Jonathan, your father&#8217;s sake. I will
give you his farm lands; and you shall eat at my table
as one of my own sons.&#8221; So David&#8217;s friendship for
Jonathan was shown to this lame prince who was crippled
in both his feet, and whose name was Mephibosheth.</p>


<h4>16. THE BABIES AND THE WISE JUDGE</h4>

<p class="center">(1 Kings 3)</p>

<p>One night a King was sleeping, and in his sleep he
dreamed that God came to him and said, &#8220;Ask what I
shall give thee.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Give me a wise heart to
judge the people justly in all things.&#8221; God said to him:
&#8220;Because you have not asked for riches, or long life,
or the death of your enemies, but have asked for a heart
of wisdom, I will give you a wise heart, and riches, and
long life if you will obey me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young King awoke; and it was a dream. But he
became one of the richest and wisest of the kings of the
earth to rule and to judge his people. One day two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
mothers came to him, each bringing a baby boy, but one
was dead and one was alive. One mother said: &#8220;O
king, judge my case! We two mothers live in one house.
One night this woman&#8217;s baby boy died, and she came into
my room and stole my little baby boy away, and put
her dead baby boy in its place while I was sleeping. In
the morning, there beside me in my bed was her dead
baby.&#8221; The other woman said, &#8220;No, no, the living is my
son, and the dead is your son.&#8221; The King said to his
servants, &#8220;Go quickly, and bring me a sword!&#8221; They
brought a sword. The King said, &#8220;Divide the living
baby in two, and give half to one and half to the other.&#8221;
The mother whose the living child was cried out to the
King, &#8220;O my lord, give her the living child; do not slay
it!&#8221; But the other said, &#8220;Yes, divide it.&#8221; Then the King
knew which was the real mother and said, &#8220;Give her the
living child; she is his mother.&#8221; All the people heard of
this, and they said, &#8220;King Solomon is the wisest man
that ever lived to rule wisely and to judge justly.&#8221;</p>


<h4>17. THE LITTLE BOY KING</h4>

<p class="center">(2 Kings 11)</p>

<p>There were troublous times in a king&#8217;s palace when a
little prince was born. He was only two months old when
his father, the king, was killed in battle and this little
baby boy had to be hidden away by his aunt in a storeroom
in the sacred temple to save his life. For seven
years he was hidden there and very few knew that the
little boy, who should be the king, was alive. His grandmother,
a very wicked and cruel woman, Athaliah, became
queen. She first ordered all the royal children she
could find to be put to death and then she did many
such cruel and evil things so that her people became
worse and worse. After seven long years, one day a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
good man in the temple told five brave captains his
secret, and showed them the young king and asked their
help to crown him king in the place of the wicked, cruel
grandmother. They promised. Soon many other soldiers
came to know the secret, and on a day they decided
upon, these men armed themselves with swords and
spears and shields, and gathered in the temple to crown
the little boy king. His granduncle, the high priest,
brought him out from his hiding-place, set him upon a
high platform, put a little crown of gold upon his head,
while all the men clapped their hands and cried, &#8220;Long
live the king!&#8221; When the queen-grandmother heard the
shouts she came to the temple and looked in, and behold,
there was the little boy king standing on the platform
with the crown upon his head and all the captains and
guards and trumpeters and people rejoicing and blowing
trumpets. The queen tore her clothes in anger and
cried out, &#8220;Treason! Treason!&#8221; But all her soldiers
and people were sick and tired of her cruel reign. So the
captains seized her, led her out of the temple, and slew
her near the horse-gate of her palace. So this little boy
only seven years old was crowned king because he was
of the family of King David and because God took care
of him in his hiding-place during all those seven long
years. He reigned as King of Judah many, many years,
doing great good for God and for his people. His name
was Joash.</p>


<h4>18. THE WOMAN WHO SHARED HER LAST LOAF</h4>

<p class="center">(1 Kings 17)</p>

<p>In a land where no rain had fallen for long months the
grass and flowers were withered, the fruit trees were
dead, the grain-fields and gardens were hardened and
parched, and the streams were almost dried up. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
time of this fearful famine a poor woman looked into
her jar of flour and cruse of oil, and saw that they were
almost empty. She said: &#8220;There is just enough flour to
make one more little cake, and just enough oil to mix it.
I will go and gather a few sticks and bake this little cake
for my boy and myself, and we will eat it and die.&#8221; She
went out to gather the sticks, when she heard some
one speak. She looked up and saw a strange man
standing near. He was tired and worn and dusty, as
though he had been walking many miles in the hot sun.
He said to her, &#8220;Fetch me, I pray you, a little water, that
I may drink.&#8221; She forgot for a moment how hungry
and sad she was, and started at once toward her house to
get the water for him, when he called to her, &#8220;Bring
me, I pray you, a morsel of bread in your hand.&#8221; She
turned back with a sigh and said: &#8220;O sir, truly I have
not a cake; I have only a handful of meal in the jar, and
a little oil in the cruse; and now I am gathering two
sticks that I may go in and prepare for me and my boy
that we may eat it and die.&#8221; The man said: &#8220;Fear not;
go and do as you have said, but make me a little cake
first, and bring it out here to me, and afterward make a
cake for yourself and your boy. For Jehovah, the God
of Israel says, &#8216;The jar of meal shall not be empty,
neither shall the little bottle of oil be empty, until it
rains upon the earth.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood and looked at this strange man with his
strange request&mdash;to share her very last piece of bread.
She did not know who he was, nor who the God was he
spoke of; she only knew that this man with the tired face
was hungry too, and he had not even one piece of bread,
and she said to herself, &#8220;I will share what we have with
him.&#8221; She went back into her kitchen, kindled the fire
with the sticks, scraped the last bit of flour from the jar,
and poured in the last drop of oil from the cruse; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
when she had taken out enough for the little cake and
looked into the jar and cruse, there was just as much
flour and oil as before. She made the cake, took it to
Elijah, God&#8217;s wonderful prophet, and she, and he, and
her son had plenty to eat from the jar of meal that did
not empty and the cruse of oil that did not fail all the
days of that famine. And it all came about because that
good woman, though hungry herself, was willing to share
the little she had with another who was in need.</p>

<h4>19. THE SLAVE-GIRL WHO HELPED A GREAT CAPTAIN</h4>

<p class="center">(2 Kings 5)</p>

<p>One day a sweet-faced little girl was playing in her
home as happy as any little girl could be, all unconscious
that a cruel battle was being fought. Suddenly some soldiers
came and seized this little girl and carried her away
with other prisoners to a far-off land where she was sold
and became a slave-girl in the house of a great captain.
She had to do errands for his wife and wait upon her,
and do anything she asked. Often when this little girl
was in her mistress&#8217;s room she saw big tears run down her
cheeks, and a sad look come upon her face. One day she
found out what made the tears. Captain Naaman was a
leper. That was a terrible disease in his flesh which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
doctor could cure. The little girl had often seen Captain
Naaman. She thought he looked so fine in his rich uniform
as he rode away in a chariot with prancing horses.
She knew that the king of that land had made him captain
over all his soldiers because he was so brave. &#8220;But
he is a leper, he has leprosy&mdash;how sad!&#8221; she kept saying
to herself; &#8220;how I wish I could help him!&#8221;</p>

<p>One day a thought flashed into her mind that made her
eyes sparkle with joy. She knew in her own land there
was a great and good man named Elisha who had done
many wonderful things in helping people. She said, &#8220;I
am sure he could make Captain Naaman well.&#8221; She
could hardly wait to be sent for to do another errand,
she was so eager to tell her mistress about Elisha. At last
the call came, and as soon as she went into her mistress&#8217;s
room, she said, &#8220;There is a good man in my land, Elisha,
who could heal my master.&#8221; The mistress looked at her
and said, &#8220;Tell me, daughter, tell me what you mean!
Who is Elisha?&#8221; And the little girl told her all about
the wonderful things the prophet had done. When Captain
Naaman came home his wife told him what the little
girl had said. The captain went to the palace and told
the king, who said, &#8220;I will send a letter to the King
of Israel; get ready to go.&#8221; So Captain Naaman started,
riding in a beautiful chariot, drawn by prancing horses,
the king&#8217;s servants riding beside him, carrying gifts of
gold and silver and beautiful clothes which the king was
sending as presents to the King of Israel. Every one
looked as they rode away. The little girl was the most
excited of all. At last Captain Naaman and his soldiers
and chariot stopped at the door of the little house of
Elisha, but the prophet did not even come out to see
Naaman&#8217;s fine things, but simply sent a messenger to
him, saying, &#8220;Go and wash in the river Jordan seven
times and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
shalt be clean.&#8221; Naaman was angry and started to go
back home as much a leper as he had come. But when
his servants reasoned with him and persuaded him to
do what the prophet said, he went down to the river Jordan,
and dipped himself&mdash;once, twice, thrice, four times,
five times, six times, seven times&mdash;when lo! his rough,
red skin became soft and smooth as the skin of a little
baby. Naaman was so pleased that he hurried back to
the little house of the prophet to reward him, but not a
thing would Elisha take from him. Then the captain
hastened back to his own land and home. His wife and
the little girl saw him coming. Up the street he rode
and stopped in front of the beautiful house. &#8220;He is
well! He is well!&#8221; cried the little girl. Then she knew
a little girl can indeed be a great helper.</p>


<h4>20. FOUR COLLEGE BOYS WHO KEPT STRONG</h4>

<p class="center">(Daniel 1)</p>

<p>Four boys, who were great friends, were taken from
their homes and carried far away into a great city in a
foreign land to live among strangers. One day the King
ordered his officers to select from among the Jewish captive
boys four of the brightest, and these four boys were
chosen and brought into the King&#8217;s palace to be educated
for three years in the King&#8217;s college for royal service.
Thinking it a great honor to them, and that it would
make them strong, the King ordered that these boys
should be given a daily supply of the rich food and wine,
such as he and all his military cadets received. But the
very first time the silver tray, with all of these dainties,
was brought to these four college boys, one of them,
whose name was Daniel, said to the officer who took charge
of them, &#8220;Please let us not have this rich food and
wine, but have plainer food.&#8221; The officer laughed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
said: &#8220;I am afraid that if you do not eat this rich food
your faces will become thinner than those of the other
college students, and then the King will cut off my
head!&#8221; But Daniel said: &#8220;Try us ten days. Give us
only vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then look
at our faces and the faces of the other boys that eat the
King&#8217;s rich food and drink his wine, and see.&#8221; The
officer said he would try them for ten days. He did so,
and at the end of that time their faces were fatter and
rosier, their bodies plumper, and their minds clearer,
stronger, and brighter than all the other boys. At the
end of the three college years, the King sat upon a golden
throne, and all the students were brought before him, and
he saw that these four were stronger than all the rest,
and that they knew ten times as much as the magicians
and astrologers in all his kingdom. So Daniel, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, these four friends who were
true to their principle, showed after all that they kept
their health and were stronger and better by going without
the rich food and the royal wine.</p>


<h4>21. FOUR FRIENDS IN THE FIERY FURNACE</h4>

<p class="center">(Daniel 3)</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sight to see the King&#8217;s golden
image which he had set up in the great plain. The King
was a worshiper of images of wood and stone, and he
sent forth his herald with a loud trumpet to cry aloud
&#8220;To you it is commanded, O people, nations and languages,
that when ye hear the sound of the instruments
of music, ye shall fall down and worship the golden
image that Nebuchadnezzar, the King, hath set up; and
whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall the same
hour be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.&#8221;
From all the country and provinces around people came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to see this great image and to worship, and at the sound
of the instruments of music all fell down and prayed to
it, except three young men who stood upright looking
before them, without bowing their heads or knees to the
golden image. These were the three Hebrews, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, the friends of Daniel, who must
have been away on a journey at that time. When this
was told to the King he was very angry and ordered
them at once to worship his image or be cast into the
furnace, which they saw in front of them glowing with
a terrible fire. They said to the King: &#8220;Our God is able
to save us from your fiery furnace, and he will save us.
But if he does not, be it known unto you, O King, we
will not worship the golden image you have set up, or
serve your gods of gold.&#8221; The King was more angry, and
ordered his strong men to make the fiery furnace seven
times hotter and cast these three friends into the midst
of it. But they were not afraid though they were tied
with ropes and cast into the fire, which was so hot the
flames leaped out and burned up the men who threw
them into it. The King was sitting where he could look
right into the furnace. A few moments after, he sprang
up greatly astonished and cried: &#8220;Look, look; did we
not cast three friends into the furnace? Lo, I see four
men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they
are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son
of God!&#8221; The King ran to the mouth of the furnace,
crying, &#8220;Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, ye servants of
the Most High God, come out!&#8221; And they came out
of the fire, and not a hair of their heads was singed, nor
were their coats scorched, nor was there even the smell
of burning on them. And it all came about because these
three friends were loyal to the one true God, who had
sent the other Friend, &#8220;the form of the fourth,&#8221; to deliver
them out of the burning fiery furnace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>


<h4>22. THE MAN WHO WAS NOT AFRAID TO PRAY</h4>

<p class="center">(Daniel 6)</p>

<p>Daniel was the man who dared to stand alone in work,
in worship, and in play. He could be trusted in everything.
Because he was so industrious, faithful, and
thoughtful, the new King promoted him to be next to
him in rule over all the land. The other officers were
jealous and set plans for his downfall. They persuaded
the King, Darius, to sign this law: &#8220;Whosoever shall pray
to any god or to man for thirty days, save to thee, O
King, he shall be cast into the den of lions.&#8221; The King
was delighted to think of every one in the city praying
to him just as if he were a great god, so he signed this
wicked law. Daniel knew what these evil men would do,
but when the time came at noonday for him to pray, he
went straight to his home, opened wide his windows
toward his old home in Jerusalem, as he was accustomed
to do, and knelt down and prayed and gave thanks to his
God. That night he did the same thing. He could have
waited until he was in bed where none could see him say
his prayers. Or he could have left his window closed.
But he was not afraid of the King or his officers. They
were watching down the street, like detectives peeking
from behind the corners perhaps, and when they saw
Daniel pray they hurried to the King and told him.
Darius loved Daniel and was sorry he had signed the
law, but as the laws of that land could not be changed, he
said that Daniel must die. So Daniel was brought to the
great cave of the hungry, roaring lions. The cage was
opened at the top and Daniel was thrown right down into
the midst of the wild animals. The King was sad and
said, &#8220;Daniel, your God will deliver you!&#8221; Then the
King went back to his palace, but he was so sad he
could not eat nor hear music. All night long he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of Daniel, how good and useful he had been, and how
cruelly treated. Early in the morning he arose, hurried
to the cave, looked in, and there was Daniel&mdash;alive and
well. The King cried out, &#8220;O Daniel, servant of the
living God, has your God delivered you from the lions?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Daniel, &#8220;my God has sent his angel
to shut the lions&#8217; mouths, and they have not hurt me.&#8221;
The King was glad. He called his servants to come and
take Daniel out of the den. When he was drawn out
there was found not even a scratch upon him. The King
said, &#8220;Bring those mean and jealous men, who tried to
kill Daniel, and cast them into the den.&#8221; So they were
caught and cast into the den, and so hungry were the
lions that before the men reached the floor of the den the
beasts had seized them and were crunching their bones
to pieces. Then the King made a new law that all in his
kingdom should pray to Daniel&#8217;s God, who had delivered
him out of the lions&#8217; den, and who had given him the
power to dare to stand and to pray alone.</p>


<h4>23. THE GOLDEN SCEPTER IN THE PALACE OF THE LILY</h4>

<p class="center">(Book of Esther)</p>

<p>Once a King gave a great feast in his Palace of the
Lily to all his people. They drank wine from cups of
gold in the garden court of the palace which was paved
with red marble and mother of pearl. On the seventh
day of the feast, being drunk with wine, the King ordered
his officers to bring out Queen Vashti in her royal robes
that the princes and people might look at her, for she
was very beautiful. She refused. So the King said she
should be cast out of the Palace of the Lily, and another
Queen chosen in her place&mdash;the most beautiful woman
they could find. One was chosen whose name was Esther,
a captive in Persia. Her father and mother were dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and her cousin, Mordecai, had brought her up as his
own daughter. He was a proud old man who always did
what was right, and so he displeased many persons,
among whom was Haman, the ruler next to the King.
Because Mordecai would not bow down to him, Haman
planned to kill the stern old man and with him all the
Jews in the land. He persuaded the King to give a command
that on a certain day all Jews, young and old,
women and little children, should be slain. There was
great distress among the Jews, but Haman was happy
with the King, drinking wine and talking over his great
decree. Esther did not know what had happened until
she saw her cousin weeping, and then he told her that
her life was in danger too, unless she went to the King
and pleaded for her people. She said: &#8220;Every one knows
that whoever goes before the King into the inner court,
who is not called, is put to death, unless the King holds
out his golden scepter, and for the last thirty days the
King has not called me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mordecai replied: &#8220;Do not think you will escape! No,
if you fail us now, safety will come by others, but you
will perish; and who knows whether you are not come
to the kingdom for such a time as this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Esther said: &#8220;Go, gather together all the Jews
and pray three days and three nights for me, and I will
go before the King, and if I perish, I perish!&#8221; At the
end of three days she put on her royal robes, went into
the inner court, and stood opposite the King as he sat
on his throne. When he saw her he held out his golden
scepter, and said, &#8220;What is your wish, Queen Esther?
Speak and you shall have it to the half of my kingdom!&#8221;
She said, &#8220;May it please the King to come to-day with
Haman to a banquet that I have prepared.&#8221; At the
banquet the King again asked her wish, and she said, &#8220;If
it please the King, come again to-morrow to a banquet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
with Haman.&#8221; Haman was delighted as he went home
and told his wife and friends about his good fortune;
but he said, &#8220;I am unhappy as long as Mordecai refuses
to bow down to me!&#8221; They said, &#8220;Build a gallows, and
ask the King to let Mordecai be hanged on it.&#8221; He did
so. But that same night the King read in the book of
golden deeds how true Mordecai had been to a former
King, and he knew that this service had never been rewarded.
When Haman came in the King said, &#8220;What
shall be done to the man whom the King delights to
honor?&#8221; Thinking it must be himself the King meant,
he said: &#8220;Let royal apparel be given him and a royal
horse, and a royal crown, and bid him ride through the
city for the people to honor.&#8221; The King said, &#8220;Then
make haste and do all this for Mordecai.&#8221; This he had to
do. And when he went to the Queen&#8217;s banquet he was
not happy. The King said: &#8220;What is your wish, Queen
Esther? Speak and I will give it, to the half of my
kingdom.&#8221; She said: &#8220;O King, let my life and my
people&#8217;s life be given me; for we are sold, I and my
people, to be slain and to perish.&#8221; The King said, &#8220;Who
is he? where is he that dares to do so?&#8221; Esther pointed
to Haman, and said, &#8220;There he is, this wicked Haman!&#8221;
Haman was afraid, and pleaded with the Queen to ask
the King to spare his life, but the King said, &#8220;Hang him
on the gallows that he built for Mordecai.&#8221; This was done
at once, and when Haman was dead Mordecai was put
into his place next to the king, and all the people rejoiced.
So Queen Esther, to whom the King extended the golden
scepter in the Palace of the Lily, saved all her people, the
Jews, that day and they lived in peace and prosperity.</p>

BIBLE STORIES FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT</h3></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Adapted for Children, Six to Twelve Years.</i>)</p>


<h4>1. THE FIRST CHRISTMAS DAY</h4>

<p class="center">(Luke 2)</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> starry night, in a grassy field outside a little
village, a company of shepherds were watching their
sheep that were fast asleep. The men were talking together
of the wonderful Saviour-King who had been so
long promised to the world. Suddenly a bright light
shone around them and, in a moment a beautiful angel
appeared and stood near them. The shepherds were
afraid and fell on their knees, while the angel said:
&#8220;Fear not; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great
joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born
this day, in the City of David, a Saviour, who is Christ,
the Lord.&#8221; As they listened the angel continued, &#8220;This
shall be your sign; ye shall find a Babe wrapped in swaddling
clothes, and lying in a manger.&#8221; Just then the
light changed to a soft rose-color, and angels of white&mdash;a
great multitude&mdash;filled all the sky singing the glad song,
&#8220;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and
good will to men.&#8221; It was the sweetest song ears ever
heard. Soon it ceased, the angels of white went back to
heaven, and the light faded away. &#8220;Let us go at once
and see this new-born child!&#8221; the shepherds said one to
another. So they left their sheep in care of one shepherd
and hastened to the town. There they found the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Babe in a stable, wrapped in coarse clothes and lying in a
manger. By his side was Mary, his mother, and Joseph.
They knelt down beside the manger, looked into the wide-open
eyes of the Christ-Child, and told Mary and Joseph
of the wonderful light, and of the song and sign of the
angels. It was morning when the shepherds went back
to their sheep, but they never tired of telling that the
Christ-Child was born, and that the angels had said he
should bring &#8220;peace on earth and good will to men.&#8221;
That was the first Christmas Day.</p>


<h4>2. THE WISE MEN AND THE STAR</h4>

<p class="center">(Matthew 2)</p>

<p>In other lands besides the one in which the Christ-Child
was born, good men often talked together of the
promise of his coming to the world. One night, in a far-away
land, a wise man who liked to study the stars,
was looking up into the sky, and saw a star he had never
seen before. &#8220;There is the star of the Christ-Child!&#8221;
he cried; &#8220;I will go and find him and take him a gift of
gold!&#8221; So he mounted his camel and started. Soon he
met another man riding a camel. This man said, &#8220;Where
are you going?&#8221; &#8220;I have seen the star of the Christ-Child,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and I am going to find him.&#8221; &#8220;I saw
the star too, and I will go with you,&#8221; said the man; &#8220;I
shall give him a gift of my sweetest incense.&#8221; Soon they
met a third man riding on a camel. &#8220;I too,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;saw this wonderful star, and am seeking the Child-King.
I have for him a gift of myrrh, my most precious
perfume!&#8221; So they journeyed together&mdash;on and on&mdash;ever
following the star until they came at last to the
little town of Bethlehem, and the star stood shining over
the little house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ike! Ike!&#8221; each traveler shouted to his camel. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
meant &#8220;Kneel; kneel!&#8221; The camels slowly knelt down;
each man put his foot on his camel&#8217;s neck, stepped upon
the ground, and went into the house, where they saw the
young child and fell down and worshiped him. Then
they opened their bags and gave for the Star-Child their
best gifts, of gold, and frankincense, and myrrh, such as
were given only to kings. Some time after they returned
home to their study of the stars again, but they never forgot
the star that led them to the Child-King who was born
to bring to the world &#8220;peace and good will, good will and
peace.&#8221;</p>


<h4>3. WHEN JESUS WAS A BOY</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>An Imaginary Sketch.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(Luke 2: 40, 52.)</p>

<p>When Jesus was a boy he lived in a little country town,
called Nazareth. It was a beautiful place, with little
white stone houses, and little narrow streets; high green
hills rising above it; many gardens full of bright flowers&mdash;roses,
tulips, lilies, orchids, and wild geraniums;
orchards of fig trees, olive trees, and orange trees; cooing
doves and other birds flitting here and there on the housetops
and among the trees; and in the center of the town
there was a fountain from which water was carried by
the people to their homes in large stone jars borne on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>The house in which Jesus lived had only one room with
a dirt floor. It had no window except a hole in the
wall; no bedstead, no chair, no pictures, no looking-glass.
The people in these poor houses ate their meals from a
low bench or shelf as they sat or reclined upon the floor
or upon cushions. They slept upon quilts spread on the
floor at night and neatly folded up by day. The only
furniture was a chest or cupboard on one side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
room, where they kept their best clothes. Near the door
stood the jar of water for drinking, cooking, and cleansing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_152f.jpg" alt="WHEN JESUS WAS A BOY" /></div>

<p class="caption">WHEN JESUS WAS A BOY</p>

<p>When Jesus was a boy he wore a bright, red coat with
long sleeves and tied around his waist with a sash of
different colors. When he was very little he wore no
shoes or stockings. Later he wore little sandals. Sandals
were taken off when people entered a house. Perhaps it
was easier for a boy then to take off his sandals than to
wipe his shoes on the door-mat as boys should do now.
But these boys had to wash their feet as they came indoors,
and perhaps that would be harder for a boy who
doesn&#8217;t like to wash even his hands when he comes into
the house now.</p>

<p>When Jesus was five years old he began to attend the
village school with other boys. After school was over
he loved to play games with the other boys around the
village fountain or upon the level place on the hillside.
He played &#8220;funeral&#8221; and &#8220;wedding&#8221; and many games
such as boys play now. He used to climb to the top of the
green hills gathering wildflowers, watching the birds,
and perhaps sometimes he would chase the butterflies, but
if he caught them he would never hurt them. He helped
his mother feed the doves and the chickens, often laughing
heartily as he saw the chicks run to hide under the
mother&#8217;s wings.</p>

<p>Every Sabbath he went to the village synagogue, which
was the same place as the day-school. He listened attentively
to the minister reading and explaining the Bible.
After the synagogue service all the children stayed to
the Bible school. All the children sat on the dirt floor
and listened to the Old Testament read and explained.
Boys, like Jesus, were glad to learn a great deal of the
Bible by heart and then to repeat it from memory.</p>

<p>Jesus&#8217; father, Joseph, was the village carpenter. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
made and repaired stools, mangers, plows, yokes, and
such things for the home and farm. Jesus doubtless
loved to be in the carpenter shop, helping Joseph by
bringing saw and hammer, holding a board, and learning
all he could. Jesus and Joseph were chums and partners,
always trying to help each other. We may imagine that
one day Jesus saw an Arab in the village making a tent.
When Jesus got home he said, &#8220;I would like to have a
tent.&#8221; So Joseph helped him, and he soon learned to
smooth and sharpen the pegs, sew cloth together, and
when at last the tent was finished and put out in the
garden, no boy was ever happier lying under his own
tent that his own hands had made, than Jesus was. One
day, perhaps, Joseph took Jesus over to the lake, where
they went fishing. What fun that was to Jesus, as well
as the rowing and sailing and swimming in the lake!
When he got home he said, &#8220;Let us make a little boat
for little brother.&#8221; So they made a nice boat and gave
it as a plaything to amuse his little brother.</p>

<p>Often his mother called, &#8220;Jesus, please get some water
in the jars.&#8221; Jesus started on the minute. He never
said, &#8220;Oh pshaw! ask brother!&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to!&#8221; or
&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; No, Jesus went at once, and more
often saw what was wanted to be done and did it without
waiting to be told.</p>

<p>Jesus was the kind of boy that helps everybody. So
everybody liked Jesus. He studied his lessons well. He
always played fair with the boys. He was kind and loving
and good to all. He loved everybody, and everything
he did he did with his whole heart and tried to do well.</p>

<p>In the evening his father and mother often gathered
the children together and told them the beautiful stories
from the Bible&mdash;and Jesus loved especially those about
Abraham and Joseph and Samuel and David and Daniel.</p>

<p>So when Jesus was a boy he was a real boy&mdash;a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
boy, the best thinking, feeling, speaking, acting boy the
world ever saw, just the kind of boy that God wants
every boy to be, &#8220;growing in body, in mind, in soul,
and in favor with God and man.&#8221;</p>


<h4>4. WHEN JESUS WAS LOST</h4>

<p class="center">(Luke 2: 41-52)</p>

<p>One morning when Jesus lived in the little white stone
house in Nazareth, his father, Joseph, said: &#8220;Jesus, you
are now twelve years old. You are to go to the feast in
Jerusalem with us this year.&#8221; This made Jesus very
happy. He had been looking forward a long time to the
day when he could go to the great city of Jerusalem that
was to him the most sacred and most wonderful city in
the world. So, when the morning to start came, Jesus
was ready. When they started there were great throngs
of people from different towns and lands going up to the
feast, traveling together and crowding the roads. The
women and aged men rode on donkeys, or mules, or
horses, or camels. The men walked by their side, staff in
hand. The boys ran on before or played by the side
of the road. These great caravans of people slowly
traveled together as far as they could by day and rested
at night in tents or booths. The boys had tents in which
they could sleep together, and Jesus was with the boys.
On the fourth day, suddenly in the distance, on a hill,
Jesus caught the first glimpse of the high towers and
great walls of the city, and the shining roof of the temple
and palaces. The people cried out, &#8220;Jerusalem! Jerusalem!&#8221;
singing psalms of joy together, accompanied by
music of various instruments, as they journeyed onward.
Soon they reached the city. It was a new and wonderful
world to Jesus, this wondrous boy of twelve years old,
who had lived in the country and had never seen a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
city before. He opened his eyes wide to see the crowded
streets, the marble palaces, the strong towers, and then the
temple courts and buildings. He saw the bright robes of
the priests. He saw the smoking altars and their bleeding
sacrifices of oxen and lambs and doves. He stood in
front of the great blue veil of the holy of holies and
wondered what was within. He knew this was his heavenly
Father&#8217;s house, and he liked to be there better than
anywhere else. He watched the daily sacrifice and all
parts of the feast. During the seven days of the feast,
Jesus walked about the streets looking at the stores, the
wonderful articles for sale, the animals for sacrifice, the
forts, the great gates, and other interesting things in
the city, but he always liked to go back to the wonderful
temple.</p>

<p>When the feast was over, Joseph and Mary started
toward home. But as the roads were so crowded, especially
toward Nazareth, with the thousands of returning
pilgrims, his parents, supposing he was in the company,
did not discover that he was missing until they pitched
their tents at the close of their first short day&#8217;s travel.
Jesus was lost. They searched everywhere and asked
everybody they met, and when they could not find him
they were greatly worried, fearing that King Herod
might have caught him and put him to death. They
hurried back to the city very early the next morning and
searched everywhere for the missing boy but could learn
nothing of him. At last, on the third day, they went into
one of the side rooms of the temple, a room where the
teachers and wise men met, and there was Jesus in the
center of a group of white-bearded teachers, listening
earnestly to what they said, and asking them harder questions
than they had ever heard before. Mary said:
&#8220;Jesus, my son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold,
thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Jesus replied: &#8220;Mother, how is it that you sought me?
Did you not think that I would be here, in my Father&#8217;s
house?&#8221; While Jesus had been at the feast during those
seven days he had found out what every boy and girl
sooner or later must find out, what he is to do and to be
in the world. But though Jesus now knew what he was
to be and do, yet at once he said to the great teachers,
&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; and went back with his parents to Nazareth,
a cheerful, obedient Jewish boy.</p>

<p>And in all that land no son was ever so thoughtful, so
kind, so loving, and so helpful to his parents and to his
brothers and sisters, as was this noble boy and young
man, whom his neighbors knew as Jesus, the young carpenter
of Nazareth.</p>


<h4>5. WHEN JESUS LEFT HIS CARPENTER SHOP</h4>

<p class="center">(Mark 1: 1-11)</p>

<p>When Jesus was the young carpenter in Nazareth he
was the best carpenter of all the land. The children, passing
by, liked to peep in at the open door of his shop and
see him at work with his saw or hammer, making or repairing
a stool, or a chest, a manger, a plow, or a yoke.
He smiled sweetly at the children and spoke kind words
to them, so that the children of Nazareth loved him in
return. But one day as Jesus was standing beside his
bench, with the shavings at his feet and his carpenter&#8217;s
tools about him, he knew that very soon he must leave
that shop and go into the towns and cities where there
were other things for him to mend than stools and chests
and mangers and plows and yokes. At last, one evening,
when the shadows lengthened, he went into his carpenter&#8217;s
shop and hung up his hammer, his saw, his adz, and each
of his carpenter&#8217;s tools, shut the door of his shop, said
&#8220;Good-bye&#8221; to his mother and his brothers and sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and friends in Nazareth, and early next morning started
on a long walk over the hills and valleys toward the river
Jordan.</p>

<p>A strange preacher named John, the Baptizer, had come
out of the wilderness to the banks of the river Jordan,
preaching that everybody should repent of his sins and
prepare for the coming of God&#8217;s Son by being baptized
in the river, confessing his sins. John was dressed in a
rough coat made of camel&#8217;s hair, and had lived in the
desert eating nothing but honey and an insect, something
like a grasshopper, called a locust. But thousands of
people came to listen to this strange preacher of the
desert and to be baptized.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as a great crowd was around him, John
suddenly stopped in his preaching, and looking at a man
coming near, he cried, &#8220;Look, there is God&#8217;s Son!&#8221; All
eyes were turned toward the quiet and gentle form of
Jesus, who walked forward and said to John, &#8220;I would
like to be baptized.&#8221; John drew back, and said, &#8220;Oh, no,
no! You should baptize me, rather than that I should
baptize you.&#8221; But when Jesus said, &#8220;It is God&#8217;s will,&#8221;
John took hold of his hand and together John and Jesus
slowly stepped out on the pebbly shore, and walked into
the river, with every eye upon them. Standing out in the
water, Jesus prayed. Then John baptized Jesus. And
as Jesus came up out of the water, suddenly the sky
seemed to open, and a beautiful snow-white dove flew
down and rested upon the head of Jesus. Then a Voice
from heaven was heard that said, &#8220;This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the announcement that Jesus was the Son of
God and the Saviour of the world. It meant that Jesus
would return to the carpenter shop no more. No more
would the farmer bring his plow for Jesus to repair. No
more would the housemother bring her stool to Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to mend. In vain would the children passing by his shop
look in at the open door to see his pleasant smile or hear
his kind voice. The saw and the hammer and the adz
were for other hands now. Jesus had entered upon his
great task of mending and healing human hearts and
lives, of bringing &#8220;Peace on earth, good will to men,&#8221;
a task in which every one who loves him and is like him
may still share a part.</p>


<h4>6. WHEN JESUS WON HIS GREAT VICTORY</h4>

<p class="center">(Matthew 4: 1-11)</p>

<p>When Jesus was a boy and a young man in Nazareth, he
was sometimes tempted to do wrong things or to do right
things in a wrong way. But he had decided always to
do what pleased God, his heavenly Father, and so he
met every temptation to do wrong with a firm &#8220;No!&#8221;
which each time won him a new victory, as it will with
any one.</p>

<p>Immediately after his baptism in the river Jordan
Jesus was tempted more than ever before because his
baptism was the beginning of his public life as the Son
of God and Saviour of men. Satan, the tempter, said, &#8220;I
will make him do something that will not please God!&#8221;
So, far off in the desert, where Jesus withdrew to plan
the best way to begin his life-work, and when he had
fasted for forty days and was very hungry, Satan came to
Jesus in some strange form and said, &#8220;If thou art the
Son of God, command that these stones become bread.&#8221;
He pointed to some round, smooth stones lying near that
looked very much like loaves. Jesus knew that he could
command them to become bread, but he said: &#8220;No, God
does not want me to use my power for myself, but for
others. It is better to obey God and do right than even to
get bread when one is hungry. God says in his word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
&#8216;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
that comes from the mouth of God,&#8217;&#8221; So Jesus refused
to do what Satan said to satisfy his hunger, and won the
first inning of his great victory.</p>

<p>The tempter tried another plan. He seemed to take
Jesus suddenly to one of the highest towers of the temple
in Jerusalem where he said: &#8220;If thou art the Son of God,
cast yourself down and surprise the people, for God&#8217;s
word says, &#8216;He will give his angels charge over thee, and
they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy
foot against a stone.&#8217;&#8221; Jesus knew that he could easily
do this, but he said: &#8220;No, the angels of God only take
care of God&#8217;s children when they do right in a right way
to please him. It is written in God&#8217;s word, &#8216;Thou shalt
not tempt the Lord thy God.&#8217;&#8221; So he refused the
tempter, and won the second inning of his great victory.</p>

<p>The tempter tried a third time. He seemed to carry
Jesus up into a very high mountain, from which he could
see the whole world and all the glory of it. Satan said:
&#8220;All these things will I give thee if thou wilt fall down
and worship me. The Jews want a Sword-King. Become
a Sword-King and lead them out to fight their enemies,
and you will win, for I will help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get thee hence, Satan,&#8221; cried Jesus immediately, &#8220;for
it is written in God&#8217;s word, &#8216;Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and him only shalt thou worship.&#8217;&#8221; Jesus refused
to be Satan&#8217;s Sword-King, and chose to be God&#8217;s
kind of king, a Peace-King. So Jesus won the third
inning of his great victory.</p>

<p>Then Satan left Jesus. God&#8217;s angels brought him food
to sustain him and encouragement to revive him. And
Jesus was stronger still to do always those things that
pleased his heavenly Father, who would give him help to
win other victories through life, as he had helped him to
win this first great victory.</p>

<h4>7. THE CHILDREN&#8217;S FRIEND</h4>

<p class="center">(Matthew 19:13-15)</p>

<p>One day a great crowd of men gathered about Jesus,
the great Teacher. All sorts of men were there&mdash;rich
men and poor men; soldiers with their swords and spears
and sandals; rough fishermen, barefooted, fresh come
from their boats and nets; and priests dressed in their
long, white robes with colored fringes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the great Teacher was speaking, at the
farther edge of the crowd a noise was heard. Some
women and children were trying to get near to Jesus.
These women wore red and blue dresses with handkerchiefs
tied over their heads, which showed they were
poor women from the little white stone houses. Some
were carrying their babies, some were holding their little
ones by the hand, and others were followed by large boys
and girls clinging to their mothers&#8217; skirts. All were
trying to press nearer to Jesus who was talking earnestly
to the people. Soon some of the close friends of Jesus
noticed these women with their children, and said:
&#8220;Women, do you not see how busy Jesus is? He has
grown-up people to talk to, and has no time for you and
your children. Take them away; carry them home where
they belong!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jesus heard what his friends said, and cried out: &#8220;Do
not send the children away. Suffer the little children to
come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the
kingdom of heaven.&#8221; There were so many of them&mdash;mothers
and their children, little babies, small children,
young boys, and girls! Jesus received them all. He let
them all come near him. He took the babies in his arms.
He laid his hands on the heads of the little children.
He put his loving arms around the larger boys and girls.
And he blessed them all. It may be he told them some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
beautiful stories, for we may be sure that the boys and
girls then loved to hear stories as well as the children do
to-day.</p>

<p>So Jesus was the friend of the children! No wonder
children like to sing:</p>

<h4>8. THE MAID AWAKENED</h4>

<p class="center">(Matthew 9:18-26)</p>

<p>Once there was a girl twelve years of age who lived
in a beautiful country house with her father and mother,
who loved her dearly. Her father was one of the chief
men of that place, a ruler, the president of Synagogue
College, and very rich.</p>

<p>One day this little girl became ill, and day by day she
grew weaker and weaker, until everybody feared she
would never be well again. One morning she lay very
white and still with her eyes closed and scarcely breathing.
Her father had left his business that day to sit by
her bedside and watch her. Tears filled his eyes as he
thought he must lose his darling daughter. All at once
the little girl opened her eyes and seeing her father&#8217;s
tears said: &#8220;Father, there&#8217;s a good man who loves children.
I saw him one day in town, and he looked at me
and spoke to me so kindly, I just loved him. His name is
Jesus. He heals the sick. I think he would make me
well.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>The father had thought of him several times, but as
some of his friends didn&#8217;t want to have anything to
do with him, he did not go to him. But when his
daughter whispered, &#8220;Please, father, tell him I&#8217;m sick,&#8221;
the father determined at once to go and get him. He
hastened to the town where he was dining in a friend&#8217;s
house. He fell at the feet of the great Teacher, crying
out: &#8220;My little daughter is dying! Please come quickly
and lay your hand on the child, and she shall live!&#8221; At
once the Teacher arose and followed the father, a great
crowd of people following, each person trying to get near
him and to look up into his face or to hear his wonderful
words. As they were on their way a poor old woman
that had been ill as many years as the little girl had been
on the earth, with a disease that no doctor could cure,
came up quietly behind Jesus in the crowd. She thought,
&#8220;If I can only touch his garment, I shall be healed.&#8221; And
as soon as she put out her finger and touched the hem
of his garment, she felt new life, and she was healed.
&#8220;Who touched me?&#8221; said the great Teacher, turning
around and looking straight at her. Then he spoke kind
and comforting words to her. All this took so much time
the father was worried and said, &#8220;O Sir, please hasten,
or my little daughter will be dead before we get there!&#8221;
But this great man was never in a hurry, having time to
help everybody. They were not much farther on the way
when they saw a man running toward them. It was the
rich man&#8217;s servant, who said, &#8220;Thy daughter is dead.
Don&#8217;t trouble the Teacher any further!&#8221; You should
have seen the sorrow written on that poor father&#8217;s face.
Jesus saw it and said, &#8220;Do not be afraid. Only believe in
me!&#8221; When they reached the house the doors were wide
open and they heard the sound of pitiful wailing and
weeping, accompanied by the flutes and other instruments
of mourning-minstrels, who did not feel sad, but merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
did this because they were paid for it. &#8220;Why make ye
this ado and weep?&#8221; said Jesus. &#8220;The maid is not dead,
but she is asleep!&#8221; After Jesus had passed, these weepers
laughed and mocked him, saying, &#8220;We know she is
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; said the Teacher with the gentle
voice. Then he took the father and mother of the maid
and three of his friends into the room where the maid
was lying so white and still and breathless. Very tenderly
he bent over her body, took her small white hand in his
own warm hand, and softly said, &#8220;Little maid, arise!&#8221;
In a moment the rose-color came back to her pale cheeks,
and she sat up in the bed, and threw her arms about her
father and mother, who could scarce believe their eyes for
joy. Then she sprang from the bed and walked, perfectly
well. &#8220;Give the maid something to eat,&#8221; said the
Teacher. Her mother quickly gave her something to eat.
Soon the servants prepared a feast for the great Teacher,
and the little maid sat next to him at the table, as happy
and as well as she could be. And she never forgot the
name of that great Friend who awakened her from her
sleep of death!</p>


<h4>9. THE BOY WITH HIS LUNCH</h4>

<p class="center">(John 6: 1-14)</p>

<p>Once there was a good boy who had a very kind-hearted
mother. Early one morning he said, &#8220;Mother,
I&#8217;d like to go fishing to-day.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the mother,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve been a good boy; take your fishing-tackle, and
here&#8217;s a nice lunch for you.&#8221; She put him up five little
cakes, such as he liked, in a basket. He went down to
the lake and fished all the morning and way into the
afternoon, and caught only two little fish, which he held
over a fire that he made, until the fish were cooked brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and looked so good to eat. He was just about to eat
them with his cakes, when he looked up and saw a great
crowd of people a little distance away whom he had not
noticed before. He wondered who they could be. So
quickly putting his five little cakes and two fishes into
the basket, he took it up, ran as fast as he could, and
pressed his way to the front, where he saw a great and
good man talking to the people so earnestly that they did
not notice the boy. Soon he was listening as earnestly as
any of them. When the great and good man had talked
a long time and no one seemed tired, one of the men
said: &#8220;I think you had better send the people home to
get something to eat. If they stay much longer they
will get so hungry they will faint by the way.&#8221; The
good man said, &#8220;You give them something to eat!&#8221; The
man laughed and said: &#8220;Why, if we bought two hundred
dollars&#8217; worth of bread and gave each person a little, there
would not be enough to go around.&#8221; When the boy
heard that, he said to a man he knew, &#8220;He can have my
lunch if he wants.&#8221; The man said: &#8220;There&#8217;s a little lad
here with five little cakes and two little fishes, and he says
you can have his lunch, if you want!&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the
good man, &#8220;let him bring it to me.&#8221; So that good boy
came right up in front of the great and good man and
gave him his lunch. The good man asked God to bless it.
Then he asked his friends to seat the boys and girls on
the green grass in rows of fifty, and the women in rows of
fifty, and the men in rows of a hundred. When they were
all seated, the good man took up one of the little cakes
and broke off a piece, and another and another and
another; but the cake did not become smaller. He kept
breaking it until there was a great deal of bread. Then
he took up one of the little fishes and broke off a piece,
then another and another and another; but the fish did
not become smaller. He kept breaking the fish until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
there was plenty. Then his friends passed the cakes
and fish around to the boys and girls. It was the sweetest
bread and fish they had ever tasted. The boy who gave
up his lunch had all he could eat, so did all the women
and all the men. When they had eaten all they wished,
there were twelve baskets full left over. And it all came
about because that good boy was willing to share his
lunch with the great and good man.</p>


<h4>10. THE DWARF IN THE MULBERRY TREE</h4>

<p class="center">(Luke 19: 1-10)</p>

<p>Once there was a very little man who was no bigger
than a young boy. He was so short that some people
called him a dwarf. He lived in a very large house, was
very rich, and had a money-making office. But no one
in the town liked Zaccheus, the dwarf, because he was not
good, or kind-hearted, or honest. People said that he had
cheated them out of money and done other bad things.
One afternoon, as he was walking along the street, suddenly
he saw in the distance a great crowd of people
coming along the main road leading into the town. The
people were shouting excitedly, &#8220;Jesus is coming! Jesus
is coming!&#8221; &#8220;How I would like to see Jesus,&#8221; said the
dwarf to himself as he ran toward the crowd and tip-toed,
trying to catch a glimpse of the great Teacher&#8217;s
face. But he wasn&#8217;t tall enough. He could see nothing
but heads towering above him. &#8220;I know what I&#8217;ll do,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll climb up into that mulberry tree
near my house. Then I can see him easily.&#8221; So he ran
quickly and climbed up into the branches of the great
tree, and waited until the crowd came close. &#8220;There he
is&#8221; he said to himself; &#8220;well, if I am a dwarf, no one
can see better than I this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat there quietly while the great procession passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
by&mdash;men, women, children, and Jesus in the midst. Soon
Jesus stopped near the tree, looked up into its branches
and cried, &#8220;Zaccheus, make haste and come down, for I
want to stop at your house to-night!&#8221; Zaccheus could
scarcely believe his ears. Was it possible that the good
Teacher would visit him, a man so wicked, hated, and
despised? How did Jesus know his name? How did he
see his hiding-place in the tree? The dwarf didn&#8217;t know,
but he hastened down at once and welcomed Jesus to his
house. In surprise some of the people cried: &#8220;Look!
Jesus is going to stay with a sinner. Does he know what
a bad man this is?&#8221; Zaccheus gave Jesus the best room
in his large house, and did all he could to make his visit
comfortable. &#8220;Prepare the best feast for Jesus,&#8221; he said
to his servants. And while they were seated at the table,
Zaccheus stood before all and said to Jesus: &#8220;Master, if
I have taken anything from any one wrongfully, I will
give him back four times over, and one-half of what is
left I will give to the poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to all the people: &#8220;Zaccheus, whom
you have despised and hated, is one of the children of
my kingdom. I came into his house to help him to be
good and kind-hearted and just. I came to seek and to
save the lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>Zaccheus, the dwarf, never forgot that afternoon when
Jesus found him seated up in the mulberry tree and spent
the night at his house and loved him when everybody
else hated and despised him.</p>


<h4>11. THE GOOD NEIGHBOR</h4>

<p class="center">(Luke 10: 25-37)</p>

<p>One day as Jesus, the great Teacher, was speaking,
a lawyer, who really wanted to know, said, &#8220;Who is my
neighbor?&#8221; and Jesus told him this beautiful story:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>Once a man was journeying over a rough and lonely
road. A band of robbers sprang upon him, struck him
down, stole his money and clothes and left him bleeding
and half dead on the road. A temple-priest happened to
pass that way, and when he saw the wounded man lying
there he said to himself, &#8220;No one can see what I do on
this lonely road.&#8221; So he crossed over to the other side,
looked at the beautiful scenery, and passed on to the
temple to prayer and sacrifice, leaving the poor man uncared
for, dying in the road.</p>

<p>A temple-singer also passed that way. When he saw
the wounded man lying there he went up to him, looked
carefully at his sad condition, and said to himself, &#8220;Poor
man, I would help him if I were not so busy.&#8221; So he
passed on to his singing in the temple, leaving the poor
man uncared for, dying in the road.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward a Samaritan, a man who was not a
Jew, came along the road. He saw the wounded man
bleeding and dying, uncared for in the road, and felt
sorry for him. He saw that he was a Jew and not
one of his own people, but that made no difference.
He went up to him, raised the suffering man, and gently
poured soothing oil into his wounds, and gave him
strengthening wine. Then he helped him upon his mule
and walked by its side, while the man rode until they
came to a small hotel, where he spent the night taking
good care of him. The next morning he said to the
hotel-keeper: &#8220;Take care of him until he is well. Here
is some money, and if you spend more I will repay you
when I come this way again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jesus said to the lawyer, &#8220;Which of these three was a
neighbor to the wounded man?&#8221; The lawyer said, &#8220;The
man that showed mercy on him!&#8221; Jesus said: &#8220;Go, and
do you be as good a neighbor to all whom you have the
power to aid and to help.&#8221;</p>

<h4>12. THE STORM-KING</h4>

<p class="center">(Mark 4: 35-41)</p>

<p>Just at sunset one beautiful evening, a little fishing-boat
was sailing across a large lake. At the end of the boat
Jesus, the great Teacher, was sitting watching the gold
and red and purple of the sky reflected in the rippling
waves. Soon the moon came up and its soft, silvery
beams shone on the waves all around the boat. Then, as
Jesus was very, very tired with his hard day&#8217;s work, he
lay down on the seat and one of his fisher-friends brought
him a leathern cushion for a pillow that he might rest
easier. No sooner was Jesus fast asleep than the lake,
which had looked so lovely before with its rippling waves,
changed quickly and became rough and choppy, and the
wind began to blow very hard. The moon went under a
cloud. The wind blew fiercer and fiercer. The waves
rose higher and higher. Several of the friends of Jesus
had been fishermen and sailors on that lake all their lives,
but they never knew such a terrible storm. The wind
blew a hurricane, the waves dashed up so high that they
came over the boat, and it began to fill with water. Hurrying
to Jesus, who was sleeping soundly through all the
wind and storm and darkness, they awoke him, crying,
&#8220;Master! Master! awake, we are drowning! Save us!&#8221;
Jesus awoke and heard the wild roaring of the wind and
the torrents of rain and the dashing of the sea. Then he
arose and said to the sea, &#8220;Peace, be still!&#8221; and the wild
wind heard his voice, and ceased as a dog stops barking
when he hears his master&#8217;s command, &#8220;Be still,&#8221; or as
a crying child stops his sobs when his mother speaks. So
the noisy sea trembled; the waves sank to rest; the moon
came out again; and the lake lay still and silent. There
was a great calm. Then his friends knew that Jesus was
the Storm-King, and they said, &#8220;What a King is this&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
he commandeth even the winds and the sea and they
obey him.&#8221;</p>


<h4>13. THE KING WITH THE BASIN AND THE TOWEL</h4>

<p class="center">(John 13: 1-17)</p>

<p>One evening Jesus and his friends were gathered together
at a supper in an upper room in a house which
belonged to a friend of Jesus, and which had been loaned
for this special supper. Jesus and his friends had walked
a long distance that day over a rough and dusty road and
their feet, in the loose sandals, were sore and dusty.
Near the door stood a stone pitcher filled with cool, fresh
water, and also a basin and a towel, but there was no
servant at the door to wash their feet when they removed
their sandals and passed to their places about the table.
Each of the twelve friends of Jesus was thinking which
would occupy the highest seat in Jesus&#8217; kingdom, and
each wanted to have the highest place of honor at the
table. No one had offered to take the basin and the
towel, but rather they were even quarreling over which
should recline next to Jesus at the head of the table.
Jesus spoke not a word. He arose from the table, went
quietly over to the water-jar, laid aside his outer cloak,
tied a towel around his waist, like a servant, took up the
basin, filled it with water, and began to wash his friends&#8217;
feet, one after the other, and to wipe them with the towel.
Jesus was the King of heaven and earth! Jesus was
Lord and Master, as well as Friend. One of them should
have offered to do this. But no one thought of serving
others in any such slave&#8217;s way but Jesus. So, when he
had finished washing the feet of all, he put on his outer
cloak again, took his place at the table, and said, &#8220;He
that would be greatest of all must become the servant
of all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>
<h4>14. WHEN JESUS WAS FORSAKEN</h4>

<p class="center">(Matthew 27: 27-66)</p>

<p>For three long years Jesus went about doing good,
living for others&mdash;feeding the hungry, healing the sick,
opening the eyes of the blind, unstopping the ears of
the deaf, causing the lame to walk, raising the dead, comforting
the weary-hearted, and teaching messages of love
to all. At last untrue men, who did not love goodness
and truth, jealous because the multitudes followed Jesus,
said, &#8220;Away with him&mdash;crucify him!&#8221; And Pilate,
the Roman governor, gave the sentence, &#8220;Let him be
crucified!&#8221; That meant death on the cross, the cruel
cross on which only the worst criminals, and those mostly
slaves, were put to death for the basest crimes. So one
Friday morning about nine o&#8217;clock, Jesus, carrying the
heavy beam upon his shoulder, was led up the steep road
to a green hill outside the city wall. There they nailed
him cruelly to the cross. Jesus quietly prayed to his
Father to forgive his enemies. He also prayed for one of
the two thieves dying near him on another cross, that
God would forgive him and bring him to heaven. He
saw his mother, Mary, weeping bitterly near his cross,
and said to his friend John, &#8220;Take care of my mother,
and be a son to her.&#8221; Just at midday a sudden and
strange darkness came over all the land. There was
thunder and lightning and a great earthquake! The people
around the cross listened and heard through the
storm and out of the darkness this piercing cry from
Jesus, &#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221;
It seemed to Jesus that not only had all his disciples and
nation forsaken him, but that God, his heavenly Father,
whom he had always tried to please in everything all his
life long, had hidden away his face from him and had
forgotten and forsaken him. After three hours the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
broke out again and Jesus said, &#8220;It is finished!&#8221; Then,
&#8220;Father, into thy hands I yield my spirit.&#8221; And Jesus
was dead. To make the more sure that he was dead,
one of the soldiers pierced his side with a sharp spear,
and from the wound water and blood came forth. And
the water mingled with the blood showed that Jesus died
of a broken heart for the sins of men!</p>

<p>That evening some friends came and tenderly took his
body down from the cross and buried him in a new tomb
in a garden, and rolled a great stone across the door
of the tomb.</p>

<p>And when the stars shone out that night it was the
close of the world&#8217;s blackest day, because the King of
Love, who came to bring to men &#8220;peace and good will,
good will and peace,&#8221; had been rejected and was dead
and buried.</p>


<h4>15. THE FIRST EASTER DAY</h4>

<p class="center">(John 20)</p>

<p>Very, early on Sunday morning, the third day after
Jesus had died, some Roman soldiers were guarding the
tomb where the body of Jesus lay. Just as the first faint
streaks of dawn appeared, suddenly there was a noise and
a shaking of the ground, as a beautiful angel came down
from heaven and rolled away the great stone from the
mouth of the tomb. The face of the angel was like lightning,
and his garments were like snow. At the sight of
the angel and the opened tomb, the Roman soldiers shook
with fear and ran away as for their life. Just as they
were running out of one gate of the garden, three
women, friends of Jesus, were coming into the garden by
another gate. They were walking slowly and sorrowfully
and saying one to another, &#8220;Who will roll away
the stone from the tomb?&#8221; They were bringing fresh
cloths and spices to put around his body. It was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
dark in the garden, with only a small streak of light in
the east; but what was that bright, shining light in front
of the tomb? They hurried forward and looked&mdash;the
great rock had been rolled away and a strange and beautiful
angel was sitting upon the stone in front of the
tomb. The tomb they could see was empty. The women
were trembling with fear and surprise. But the angel
said: &#8220;Be not afraid, I know ye seek Jesus. He is not
here. He is risen. Go, and tell his disciples that he
goes before you into Galilee, and ye shall see him as he
said unto you!&#8221; Full of joy the women hurried back and
told the friends of Jesus that he was alive.</p>

<p>Another friend of Jesus came to the garden just as
soon as the women had gone. Her name was Mary.
She came to the tomb all alone, and when she looked
into the empty tomb she saw two angels in white sitting,
one at the head and the other at the foot, where the
body of Jesus had lain. These angels were strong and
beautiful, with garments dazzling white like the sun, but
she was so sad that she hardly noticed them until one of
them said, &#8220;Woman, why weepest thou?&#8221; She said,
&#8220;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not
where they have laid him.&#8221; Then she stepped back a little
distance into the garden and saw a man she thought must
be the gardener. He said, &#8220;Woman, why weepest thou?&#8221;
She said, &#8220;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me
where you have laid him.&#8221; In a low, sweet voice the
man said, &#8220;Mary.&#8221; Then she knew Jesus spoke to
her, and brushing her tears away quickly, she said,
&#8220;Teacher!&#8221;</p>

<p>So Jesus came to all his disciples, one by one, or two
or three together; until at last all knew he was risen
from the dead&mdash;that he was alive again.</p>

<p>This is the story of the first Easter Day. And this is
the reason that in Russia on Easter morning, the peasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
people say, &#8220;The Lord is risen!&#8221; and their friends
reply, &#8220;The Lord is risen indeed!&#8221;</p>


<h4>16. THE CRIPPLE AT THE BEAUTIFUL GATE</h4>

<p class="center">(Acts 3, 4)</p>

<p>One afternoon two friends were walking along a
street in Jerusalem on their way to the evening sacrifice
in the temple. At one of the entrances&mdash;the Beautiful
Gate (so named because of its snow-white marble steps
leading up to its great door of costly brass)&mdash;sat a poor
lame man, begging. His feet and ankles were so crippled
that he had never been able to walk or even to stand.
His friends carried this helpless cripple and laid him
every morning at this temple entrance to beg charity
from those who went to pray. As soon as the man saw
these two friends, Peter and John, he cried piteously,
&#8220;Give charity!&#8221; Standing still and looking him quietly
in the eye, the two friends said, &#8220;Look on us!&#8221; He
looked up at once most expectantly. Peter said, &#8220;Silver
and gold have I none, but what I have, I give thee. In
the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!&#8221; Taking
him by the hand Peter lifted him up, and immediately his
feet and ankle-bones became strong. The man leaped
up and went into the temple with Peter and John, walking
and leaping and praising God. All the people were
amazed, seeing him leaping and hearing his shouts of
joy as he held fast to his two friends. A great throng
gathered about them in the large open court, called
Solomon&#8217;s porch. Peter, seeing the throng, began to tell
them about the wonderful Prince of Life, Jesus, whom
they had put to death. Such preaching within the temple
courts aroused the people and offended the priests, and
the chief officer seized Peter and John and cast them into
prison. This caused hundreds of the people to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
themselves Christians. The next morning when Peter
and John were brought before the council and questioned,
the officers said, &#8220;We will let you go if you will promise
not to speak or teach in this name again.&#8221; They answered:
&#8220;Whether it be right in the sight of God to
hearken unto you, rather than unto God, judge ye; for
we cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard.&#8221;
So, failing to frighten them, the officers were compelled
to let them go. And being let go, they returned at once
to the Christian company, and told what the Jewish
officers had said to them. And the cripple who had been
healed at the Beautiful Gate was a happy Christian in
that company, and was one of the loudest in giving true
praise to God that day.</p>


<h4>17. THE GIRL WHO KNEW SHE WAS RIGHT</h4>

<p class="center">(Acts 12)</p>

<p>Once there was a girl, possibly about sixteen years of
age, who lived with her father and mother in the dreadful
days of the persecution against the early Christians. One
evening her mother said: &#8220;Rose, your father and I are
going to a friend&#8217;s house to-night to pray. Herod, the
wicked king, who killed the apostle James, John&#8217;s
brother, has shut up Peter in prison for several days&mdash;and
to-morrow he is going to put Peter to death. The
Christians are to pray to-night for Peter&#8217;s release from
prison.&#8221; &#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Rose, &#8220;I am a Christian too;
let me go and pray with you.&#8221; Her mother consented.
For some hours the Christians earnestly prayed; and after
midnight they were still on their knees praying, when
suddenly Rose, being nearer the door, heard a knock
on the outside gate. She quickly arose from her knees,
ran to the door and said, &#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; &#8220;It is I&mdash;I&mdash;Peter,&#8221;
came a voice. Again she said, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
&#8220;I&mdash;Peter,&#8221; came again the voice. She knew at once it
was Peter&#8217;s voice, but in her joy and excitement she forgot
to open the door, running back into the prayer-meeting
room and crying out, &#8220;Peter is out of prison!
Peter is at the door.&#8221; All arose from their knees and
said, &#8220;Rose, you must be crazy to talk like that.&#8221; &#8220;No,
I am not,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it is Peter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too bad?&#8221; said one, &#8220;Herod has already
killed Peter, not waiting until to-morrow; and God has
sent Peter&#8217;s angel to comfort us.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; cried Rose;
&#8220;no, it is not Peter&#8217;s angel; it is Peter himself! I know
I am right! Listen, there he is knocking again!&#8221;</p>

<p>All heard the knocking and went toward the gate, and
there stood Peter, alive and well. &#8220;How did you get
out of prison?&#8221; they exclaimed. &#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Peter,
beckoning them to be quiet; &#8220;let me in, and I will tell
you!&#8221; He stood just inside the gate, and this is what
he said: &#8220;Last night I was in prison, knowing well that
Herod intended to kill me this morning. I was guarded
by sixteen soldiers, and each of my wrists was chained
to a soldier, one on each side. I knew you were praying
for me, and I believed that Jesus would answer your
prayers. So I had no worry, but fell peacefully asleep,
and in my dream I thought I saw an angel come into my
cell; my chains fell off; the angel said, &#8216;Rise and put on
your sandals and cloak and follow me,&#8217; I followed the
angel past the first and second cells and the sleeping
soldiers, and when we came to the outer gate it opened
of its own accord. When we were in the street the
angel vanished. I thought it all a dream until I found
myself really out of prison with no chains on my wrists,
no soldiers guarding me, no prison-cell enclosing me. I
saw then that your prayers for me were answered, and
that Jesus had sent his angel and delivered me out of
prison. I came here as soon as I could to tell you, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
now I must go quickly to another place. Good-bye, God
bless you all!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments the gray streaks of the morning
came, and it was light. The soldiers awoke and cried,
&#8220;Where is Peter?&#8221; One after another echoed the cry,
&#8220;What has become of Peter?&#8221; No soldier and no officer
could tell, for none knew. But Rose, the Christian girl,
knew that in answer to prayer Jesus had sent his angel
and delivered Peter out of prison and she knew that
her prayer had been answered as much as the prayers
of any of the Christians, and she was glad she had been
in that prayer-meeting that night!</p>


<h4>18. THE PRISONER AND THE SHIPWRECK</h4>

<p class="center">(Acts 27)</p>

<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; cried the captain of a sailing-vessel
which was just loosing from the wharf to sail out to sea.
There, on the deck, was a number of prisoners, guarded
by soldiers. One of these prisoners was Paul, who had
been seized in the temple at Jerusalem and nearly killed
by a riotous mob. Forty men had secretly vowed not
to eat or drink until they had killed him. The captain
of the temple, being Paul&#8217;s friend, told him about the
plot, and sent him in the night with a guard of soldiers
to the governor&#8217;s house in a distant city. Paul said to
the governor: &#8220;I want to have my case tried in Rome
before the emperor, for I am a Roman citizen!&#8221; So
Paul was sent as a prisoner to Rome on this sailing-vessel.
Some of his friends were with him. One was
&#8220;the beloved physician,&#8221; Doctor Luke, who had often
traveled with him on his missionary journeys and who is
the man that tells this story. Out upon the great sea the
ship sailed until it came to a wharf where there was a
large wheat-ship sailing to Rome. Paul and the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
were put on board this wheat-ship. Counting the soldiers
and passengers there were two hundred and seventy-six
people in all. Soon their troubles began. The wind was
blowing the wrong way, so that they had to go very
slowly. But at last they came to Fair Havens, where
they stayed much too long, Paul thought, for the stormy
season of the year had come. Paul said, &#8220;You ought to
stay here for the winter.&#8221; But the captain of the soldiers
only made fun of him. The weather just then seemed
good, so they pulled up the anchors, hoisted the sails,
and put out from Fair Havens. Hardly had they started
when a terrible storm broke upon them, driving the ship
far out of its course. The ship was in danger of breaking
in two so that they had to throw great ropes around
the ship to hold it together. Then they lowered the
sails and let the vessel drift. For two weeks they were
tossed and driven by the storm, not seeing the sun or
stars. One night God sent to Paul an angel who said to
him, &#8220;Fear not, Paul, you shall reach Rome in safety,
and God will save all in the ship with you.&#8221; Early in
the morning Paul said to the sailors and soldiers, &#8220;Be
of good cheer, God will save you all.&#8221; They made fun
of him, and the ship drifted on until in the darkness
of the night they found they were near some island.
They quickly threw out four anchors to save them from
being dashed on the rocks, and longed for the morning!
As soon as daylight came and they saw the land, some
selfish sailors at the front of the boat pretending to put
out some more anchors, lowered the rowboat, and were
just getting ready to row away to the land, thinking only
of saving themselves, when Paul saw their trick and
cried out to the soldiers, &#8220;Look! except these men abide
in the ship you yourselves cannot be saved!&#8221; No one
made fun of Paul then, but the soldiers ran and cut away
the rope of the boat and let the boat fall into the sea and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
drift away. After they had eaten food they threw all
their wheat overboard to lighten the ship. As that did
not help, they decided to run the ship upon the shore,
but the bow struck the beach and the stern was broken
to pieces by the fury of the waves. Some of the soldiers
said, &#8220;Kill all the prisoners, lest they swim to the shore
and escape.&#8221; But the captain of the soldiers, who had
grown to think much of Paul, said: &#8220;No, but let each
man who can swim jump overboard and swim for the
shore first.&#8221; This they did, and the others, including
Paul and Doctor Luke, followed on planks and other
floating things from the ship. And all escaped safe to the
land. So Paul, the prisoner, was right; the ship was
lost, but God had saved all the two hundred and seventy-six
men in the ship with him!</p>


<h4>19. THE SLAVE WHO RAN AWAY FROM HIS MASTER</h4>

<p class="center">(Epistle of Paul to Philemon)</p>

<p>In the city of Colosse the Christians met in the large
house of a kind-hearted man named Philemon. He, and
his wife Apphia, and his son Archippus were so kind
to the poor Christians that the people in other cities knew
about the kindness of this fine Christian family in Colosse.</p>

<p>In those days even Christian people did not think it
wrong to keep slaves to work for them. So in the home
of Philemon there was a slave named Onesimus. Philemon
and his wife and family were kind to Onesimus, but
he was often ugly and did not like to be a slave. One
day he made up his mind that he would be a slave no
longer. He stole from his master some money which he
put into his own pocket and ran far away to the great
city of Rome. He thought he would be safe there and
could do as he pleased without any one knowing who he
was. He soon spent all the money he had stolen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
became a tramp without money, food, work, or home.
Every moment he feared lest some one should find him
and take him back to his master, for he knew that a
master had the right to put any slave to death for stealing
money and running away. One day he was walking
along a street in great sorrow wondering what to do,
when suddenly he heard singing, which sounded like that
which he used to hear at his master&#8217;s house. This made
him more homesick than ever. He listened to the singing,
wondering what it could be. Some one came out and
said pleasantly, &#8220;You are welcome to come in.&#8221; He went
in and saw a strange-looking little old man chained to a
soldier and talking to a large group of people, who were
listening eagerly as the speaker said: &#8220;I was a great sinner
once. I did many things that were wrong. But
Jesus saved me and made a new man of me. He can save
you too.&#8221; Onesimus said to himself, &#8220;He means me. He
says Jesus will save any one who is poor and lonely and
miserable. That means me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked again at the preacher and heard some one
call his name. Then he knew that this was Paul, the missionary,
who was the friend of his master, and whose
name he had so often heard Philemon mention. As soon
as the sermon was ended and many of the people had
gone home, Onesimus went to Paul and, full of sorrow
for what he had done, told him how he had stolen money
from his master and had run away. He asked Paul to
pray that the runaway slave might become a Christian.
Paul did so, and Onesimus became a new man too&mdash;a
Christian like Paul and Philemon. Then he was very
happy and said he would stay with Paul always and help
him. But Paul said, &#8220;No, my son, you must go back to
your master.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Onesimus; &#8220;if I do he
has a right to kill me for stealing and running away.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Paul, &#8220;I know that, but you must go back.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
&#8220;But what shall I say?&#8221; asked the slave. &#8220;You need
not say anything. I will write a letter to Philemon and
tell him to forgive you and receive you back as a Christian
brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul asked one of his friends for pen and ink and
paper, and this is what he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Philemon, Apphia, and Archippus</span>: I often think
of you and remember you in my prayers here in my prison in
Rome. I want to ask a favor of you for my son Onesimus, who
ran away from you as a slave, but now returns to you as a

<p>The letter is a little longer than this, but you can read
all of it in your own New Testament. This letter Onesimus
took with him as he returned to the home of his
master. Philemon treated him kindly, no longer as a
slave but as a dear son. And many people say that
Onesimus, the <i>unprofitable</i> slave, became one of the most
<i>profitable</i> Christians in all that land, ever true to Jesus
and to Paul, and to his master-friend, Philemon.</p>

<h4>1. HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Once</span> a great army came marching toward a bridge
which led into the city of Rome across the river
Tiber. &#8220;If they cross the bridge, Rome is lost!&#8221; cried
the white-haired Fathers who made the laws, for the
Roman soldiers were too few to meet so great an army.
But brave Horatius, one of the men who guarded the
bridge, stood forth and shouted, &#8220;Tear down the bridge
quickly while I and the two men with me keep the enemy
back!&#8221; Then with their shields before them and their
long spears in their hands the three brave men stood in
the road and kept back the horsemen who had been sent
to take the bridge. The Romans hewed away the beams
and posts and soon the bridge trembled and was ready
to fall. Horatius sent back his two friends, who had no
sooner reached the other side in safety than crash went
the bridge, falling into the river with a great splash.
Then Horatius knew that Rome was safe. With his face
still toward the foe, he moved slowly backward till he
stood on the river&#8217;s brink. A dart thrown by one of the
soldiers struck his left eye and put it out. But, not with a
curse, but a prayer on his lips, he leaped into the deep,
swift stream. He had his heavy armor on, and when he
sank beneath the water no one thought he would ever
be seen again. But he was strong, and the best swimmer
in Rome. The next minute he arose and swam to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
other side amid the shower of darts and javelins from
the enemy. At last when his friends pulled him up on the
bank, shout after shout went up, not only from the Romans,
but also from the enemy on the other bank, for
they had never seen a soldier so strong and brave before.</p>

<p>The Romans, in gratitude, gave him as much land as
he could plow around in a day, raised a statue in his
honor in the public market-place, and ever after to the
Roman children,</p>

<h4>2. DAMON AND PYTHIAS</h4>

<p>Once a young man who had done something that displeased
the King, was dragged to prison, and the day set
for his death. His home was far away. &#8220;Let me go and
bid good-bye to my father and mother and friends,&#8221; he
said to the King, &#8220;and I will return and die.&#8221; The King
laughed and said, &#8220;Ah! ah! he wishes to save himself!
He would never return!&#8221; A young man stepped forward
from the crowd, and said: &#8220;O King, put me in prison
until he returns. I know he will do as he has promised,
for he is a man who has never broken his word. If he
does not return, I will die for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King, surprised at such an offer of friendship,
agreed. So Pythias went to bid his friends good-bye,
and Damon was put in prison. Many days passed. By
and by the day arrived for the death of Pythias, and he
had not returned. Damon said, &#8220;I know something has
prevented, or he would be here to keep his word. I am
ready to die for him!&#8221; The jailer led him out, and was
just about to put him to death, when suddenly, far away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
on the distant road, a cloud of dust was seen growing
larger and larger. It was Pythias running, swift as the
wind, to keep his promise. He told them how he had
been hindered by storm and shipwreck. He thanked his
friend again and again for his faith in him. And then
giving himself for death into the hands of the jailer, he
was led out for execution. &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; cried the
King, &#8220;such friends must not suffer unjustly. Pythias
shall be free! And I could give all that I possess to
have one such true friend!&#8221;</p>


<h4>3. ANDROCLES AND THE LION</h4>

<p>Once a poor slave who was treated cruelly by his master
ran away into a forest and hid in a cave. Soon he heard
a dreadful roar and saw a lion limping as though his
foot hurt. Androcles went close to the lion and saw a
sharp thorn was piercing the lion&#8217;s paw. He quickly drew
the thorn out, and the lion began jumping about him like
a kitten, licking the slave&#8217;s hands and feet. Androcles
and the lion became warm friends and lived like brothers,
sharing each other&#8217;s food until one day the slave was
caught and taken back to his master; and the lion was
caught and put into a large cage. In those days any
slave who ran away from his master, when caught, must
fight a lion kept several days without food. So when
the next holiday came, Androcles was put in the great
arena with thousands of people crowding its seats to see
him die. When all was ready a door in the cage was
opened, and out bounded the lion ready to spring upon
the poor slave. With a tremendous roar the lion dashed
toward him, but to the surprise of all the people, instead
of hurting him, the lion crouched down at his feet like a
pet dog and began to lick the slave&#8217;s hands and feet.
The people cried, &#8220;O Androcles, what meaneth this?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Then Androcles put his arms around the lion&#8217;s neck and
said, &#8220;O people, in the forest I pulled a thorn out of this
lion&#8217;s foot, and that is why he does not hurt me now.&#8221;
The people were delighted and shouted, &#8220;Androcles shall
be free! Androcles shall be free!&#8221;</p>

<p>So Androcles and the lion were set free and lived
together like brothers long afterward.</p>


<h4>4. CORNELIA AND HER JEWELS</h4>

<p>One bright morning in a beautiful Roman garden two
brothers were playing among the flowers and trees.
Cornelia, their mother, a Roman lady, called the boys into
the house, saying, &#8220;A friend is to dine with us to-day,
and she will show us her jewels.&#8221; After the simple meal
was over a servant brought into the room a large and
beautiful casket of jewels, which the rich lady showed
to her friends. How eagerly the boys gazed at those
sparkling jewels&mdash;pearls, rubies, sapphires, and diamonds!
The younger boy whispered to his brother, &#8220;I wish our
mother had beautiful jewels too!&#8221; Later, when the boys
had gone out into the garden to play, the friend said, &#8220;Is
it true, Cornelia, that you are so poor that you have no
jewels?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; answered Cornelia, &#8220;I have jewels
that are far more precious than yours.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, let me see
them,&#8221; said the lady; &#8220;where are they?&#8221; &#8220;If you care
to see them I will bring them to you,&#8221; said Cornelia.
Then, calling her boys to her side, she presented them
to the lady, saying, &#8220;These are my jewels! Are they not
far more precious than your gems?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the long after-times when Cornelia&#8217;s sons became the
greatest and best men of Rome, they never forgot that
day when they knew that they were their mother&#8217;s pride
and joy and love, dearer far to her than the most
precious jewels of the rich.</p>

<h4>5. KING ALFRED AND THE CAKES</h4>

<p>Long ago in England there lived a good king, whose
name was Alfred. One day after a fierce battle with the
Danes the English soldiers were scattered and every man
had to save himself in the best way he could. King Alfred
fled alone, in great haste, through the woods and
swamps, coming late at night to a wood-cutter&#8217;s cottage.
He was very tired and hungry, and begged the wood-cutter&#8217;s
wife to give him something to eat and a place to
sleep. The good woman, not knowing who he was, invited
him into her hut. She was cooking some cakes
and so she said: &#8220;My poor, ragged fellow, you shall
have some supper if you will watch these cakes. I want
to go out and milk the cow, and you must see that the
cakes do not burn while I am gone.&#8221; King Alfred sat
down to watch them, but as his thoughts were on his people
and his plans for the next day, he forgot all about
the cakes until the woman came in and saw that they
were burned to a crisp. &#8220;You lazy fellow!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;How dare you let the cakes burn? See what you have
done!&#8221; Some people think she even struck the king
with a stick. But the king was good-natured, not caring
for her angry words half so much as for the loss of the
cakes. No doubt he had to go hungry to bed that night.
Early the next morning soldiers loudly knocked at the
door, and said, &#8220;We seek King Alfred!&#8221; Then she
knew she had treated her king shamefully. Alfred was
great and good enough to ask her forgiveness for burning
the cakes.</p>

<p>Soon after that the king gathered his men together
again, won a great battle, drove the Danes back to their
own country, and all the rest of his days ruled his people
wisely and well. But this story of King Alfred and the
Cakes has never been forgotten in all the after years.</p>

<h4>6. BRUCE AND THE SPIDER</h4>

<p>King Robert Bruce, of Scotland, longed to see his people
free from England. He had fought six fierce battles,
and six times he had been defeated, and his soldiers were
so scattered that each soldier was forced to flee for safety
into the thick woods. King Bruce himself was hiding
in a shed. He was tired and sick at heart, feeling that it
was useless to try to do anything more. Just as he was
thinking that he would give up, he looked up and saw a
spider weaving its web from one beam to another. Six
times the spider climbed up almost to the top, and each
time it fell down again. As the king watched it fall the
sixth time he said, &#8220;It will give up.&#8221; But no; up it
climbed again the seventh time, slowly, slowly, but
surely&mdash;and succeeded!</p>

<p>Bruce arose full of courage, saying, &#8220;I will try again!&#8221;
He tried again and won! That is why brave boys and
girls say to-day, &#8220;If at first you don&#8217;t succeed, try, try,
try again!&#8221;</p>


<h4>7. THE INCHCAPE BELL</h4>

<p>More than a hundred years ago there was a great and
dangerous rock called the Inchcape Rock in the North
Sea. Its top was hidden just below the surface of the
waves so that many vessels struck upon it and sank. A
kind-hearted priest called an abbot said: &#8220;I will chain
a bell to the rock, and the bell will float to and fro in
the shallow water and warn the sailors of their danger.&#8221;
Loud and clear this bell rang out, and the sailors blessed
the abbot for his kindness. But one calm, summer day a
ship with a black flag sailed that way. It belonged to
Ralph the Rover, a sea-robber, and he and his ship were
the terror of the sea. Ralph saw the bell and said to his
boatmen, &#8220;Row me to the Inchcape Rock, and we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
play a trick on the old abbot.&#8221; Being rowed to the rock
he cut the warning bell from the float, and the bell sank
with a gurgling sound. &#8220;The next who comes to this
rock will not bless the abbot,&#8221; laughed the robber as he
sailed away. Many days he sailed the seas and grew rich
with the ships he plundered. At last he sailed back home,
and in the storm and fog he longed for the sound of the
Inchcape Bell to tell him where he was. Then his vessel
struck with a fearful crash on the Inchcape Rock, and as
the waves rushed in on every side the abbot&#8217;s bell, ringing
far down on the bottom of the sea, seemed to say, &#8220;The
next who comes to this rock will not bless the abbot.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Adapted
from Robert Southey.</i></p>


<h4>8. SIR WALTER RALEIGH</h4>

<p>One morning, Elizabeth, Queen of England, was taking
her daily walk with her maids after a rain-storm that had
made the streets of London very muddy. A young man
named Walter Raleigh, who was dressed in a new, rich
scarlet plush cloak thrown over his shoulders, saw the
Queen and her maids stop at a muddy place, wondering
how they could cross. Quickly this young man, Walter,
forgot all about himself and thought only of the Queen,
and how he could help her. He took off his coat, spread
it across the muddy place, and with a graceful bow, politely
begged the Queen to do him the honor of walking
on it as upon a carpet. She crossed without soiling her
shoes, and then turned to thank the generous and polite
young man. As she walked on, she said to her maids,
&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; &#8220;His name is Walter Raleigh,&#8221; they
replied. Not long after the Queen invited this polite
young man to her palace, where she said to him: &#8220;Walter
Raleigh, I wish to reward you for your generous gallantry.
You are Sir Walter Raleigh.&#8221; That made him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
knight. He became the Queen&#8217;s favorite at the court, and
a great man in the nation. He tried to get English people
to settle in America, and he introduced two things
into England, from the Indians, which the people then
knew very little about&mdash;potatoes and tobacco. There is a
story that one day a servant, seeing the smoke curling
over his master&#8217;s head and thinking he was on fire, ran for
a pail of water, which he threw into Sir Walter&#8217;s face.
This put the fire out quickly, but it did not stop people
smoking tobacco. Would it not have been better if Sir
Walter Raleigh had left the tobacco with the Indians?</p>


<h4>9. SIR PHILIP SIDNEY</h4>

<p>Once there was a fierce battle in which a brave and
courteous knight and soldier, named Sir Philip Sidney,
was wounded while charging to the front on horseback.
He reached the camp bleeding and faint with great pain
and thirst. A soldier brought him some water, saying,
&#8220;Here, Sir Philip, I have brought you some clear, cool
water from the brook. I will raise your head so that you
can drink it.&#8221; He stooped low to raise his head, and was
just placing the water to his lips when Sir Philip saw a
foot-soldier, who was being carried past, looking with
longing eyes at the water.</p>

<p>The generous knight instantly pushed the cup toward
the dying soldier, saying, &#8220;Give it to him. His need is
greater than mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Philip Sidney died of this wound, when he was
only thirty-two years of age. On the day of his funeral
in Saint Paul&#8217;s Cathedral the rich and poor, high and low,
all felt they had lost a friend, and mourned for him as
the kindest, gentlest man that they had ever known. His
kindness to the dying soldier has caused his name to be
remembered ever since with admiration and affection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and as long as stories of noble deeds are told to future
boys and girls, this story will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>It is thought that Shakespeare, who settled in London
while all the world was talking of Sidney&#8217;s life and its
heroic ending, had him in mind when he made Ophelia
speak of Hamlet as</p>

<h4>10. THE BELL OF JUSTICE</h4>

<p>Long ago in Italy a king ordered a bell hung from a
tower in the market-place and called it &#8220;The Bell of
Justice.&#8221; He said even if a little child suffered any
wrong, he could ring the bell by pulling on the rope that
was fastened to it, and the little child should receive
justice. As the years passed many wrongs of the people
were righted for the people who rang the bell. But at
last the lower part of the rope rotted away, and a wild
grape-vine was tied to lengthen it. On the hillside above
the village lived a man who owned a horse that he
allowed to roam on the roadside, and that he left to
starve and to die in his old age, because the owner was
too miserly to feed him. One day the horse wandered
into the market-place, and seeing the green grape-vine,
the poor creature in the keen pangs of hunger began to eat
it, and in doing so rang the bell. All the people heard
the ringing. It seemed to say,</p>

</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>The judges came quickly, and when they saw the
miser&#8217;s horse nibbling at the vine, they said, &#8220;The dumb
beast has rung the Bell of Justice, and justice he shall
have.&#8221; They sent for the owner, and when he came they
said: &#8220;This horse has served you well for many years.
He saved your life several times. He helped you to
make your wealth. So we order that one-half your
money shall be set aside to provide good food, a warm
stall, and good pasture for your horse the rest of his
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miser hung his head, grieving to lose his gold. But
the people shouted for joy at the just sentence, and the
king laughed aloud:</p>

<h4>11. NAPOLEON AND THE DRUMMER-BOY</h4>

<p>One day the great general, Napoleon Bonaparte, was
in the camp reviewing his troops, when he saw a small
boy who was less than twelve years of age.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy, what are you doing here?&#8221; said Napoleon.
&#8220;I belong to the army, Sire,&#8221; replied the boy. &#8220;What
do you do in the army?&#8221; &#8220;I am a drummer, Sire.&#8221;
&#8220;Bring your drum, then,&#8221; said the general. The boy
went on the minute and brought the drum. &#8220;Now,&#8221;
said the general, &#8220;sound the general.&#8221; This is the signal
given in the army an hour before marching to strike
tents, load wagons, and get everything ready. Immediately
the boy sounded the general. Napoleon exclaimed,
&#8220;Good; now beat the march.&#8221; That is the signal for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
infantry to take their place in the column. The boy beat
the march promptly. &#8220;Now sound the advance,&#8221; said
Bonaparte, and with sparkling eyes the little drummer
sounded the advance, the signal for the cavalry to take
its place in the column. &#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed the emperor
again; &#8220;now for the charge!&#8221; And with eyes flashing
fire the little soldier beat the charge till the very rafters
of the house trembled with the vibrations of the wild,
fierce notes. &#8220;Bravo!&#8221; cried Napoleon; &#8220;now beat the
retreat.&#8221; Down went the sticks. The little fellow
straightened up, and with manly pride said: &#8220;You must
excuse me, Sire, I never learned that. Our regiment
never retreated!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are excused,&#8221; said the general laughing, and to
the end of his life Napoleon Bonaparte spoke of the little
drummer-boy who could not beat a retreat.</p>


<h4>12. PICCIOLA</h4>

<p>One spring day an Italian prisoner, shut up wrongfully
by Napoleon in one of the dreadful dungeons of
France, was permitted to walk in the prison-yard. Looking
down he saw a little mound of earth between two of
the stones in the pavement, and a tiny green leaf was
pushing its way up out of the ground. He was just about
to crush it with his foot when he noticed a soft coating
over the leaf. &#8220;This coating is to keep it safe,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;I must not hurt it!&#8221; So he went on with his walk.
The next day he saw that instead of one little green leaf,
there were two leaves, and the plant was stronger.
Every morning after that he looked to see how the little
plant had grown. He called it &#8220;Picciola,&#8221; which means
&#8220;the little one&#8221;; and it grew larger and more beautiful.
He made some ink from soot and water in order to write
down the story of this little flower, which soon had thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
beautiful blossoms on its stem. But one morning he was
in great grief, for he saw his flower beginning to droop.
He gave it water, but the stones of the prison-yard prevented
its growing. He begged the jailer to let him
remove one of the stones to save the life of his little
flower; but the prison rules were strict, and no stone
could be removed. A new thought came to the prisoner.
He would send his little story of the flower to Napoleon,
the emperor, and ask him to save his plant. A little girl
carried the message to him, and at last the good news
came that the stones of the prison-yard could be removed
so that Picciola might live. Hearing the story, Josephine,
the kind-hearted wife of the emperor, said, &#8220;No good
can come in keeping such a good man in prison.&#8221; So he
was set free, but he never forgot that he owed his liberty
not only to Josephine, but also to his little friend, Picciola.</p>


<h4>13. THE EMPEROR AND THE BIRD&#8217;S NEST</h4>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said a soldier; &#8220;look! a swallow has built her
nest in the emperor&#8217;s tent.&#8221; The soldiers looked and saw
a swallow&#8217;s nest built of clay and horse&#8217;s hair, and the
swallow sitting on her eggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, the swallow thinks the emperor&#8217;s tent is a shed,&#8221;
laughed the soldiers. The emperor, hearing his name
spoken, came out from his tent. When he saw the nest,
he said, &#8220;Let no hand molest the nest or hurt the bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the little swallow sat there quietly, amid all the
noise of cannon, hatching out her little ones, until at last
the great guns had made a breach through the walls and
the army had poured in to take the city. Then when
the terrible fighting was ended, the soldiers began taking
down their tents to go away; but when they came to the
emperor&#8217;s tent, he said, &#8220;No, no! do not take down my
tent, leave it standing!&#8221;</p>

<h4>14. THE SWISS PATRIOT AND THE SPEARS</h4>

<p>Many years ago when an Austrian army was marching
into Switzerland, Swiss peasants came down from the
mountains with bows and arrows, scythes and pitchforks,
sticks and clubs, to save their country. The Austrian
soldiers were all armed with spears and shields and shining
armor, and as they moved together in solid ranks,
what could the poor peasants do against such foes? &#8220;We
must break their ranks if we win!&#8221; cried the Swiss leader.
So bowmen shot their arrows, but they glanced from the
soldiers&#8217; shields like raindrops from a roof. Others
tried their scythes and pitchforks and sticks and clubs,
but the lines were still unbroken. The Austrians moved
steadily forward, their shields lapping over one another
and their thousand spears shining in the sunlight like so
many bristles. They were unafraid before the Swiss
sticks and stones and scythes and arrows. &#8220;We must
break their ranks or we are lost!&#8221; cried the leader again;
and in a moment a poor peasant, named Arnold Winkleried,
stepped out and cried: &#8220;My friends, on the side
of yonder mountain I have a happy home. There my
wife and my little children await my return. But they
will never see me again, for this day I give my life for
my country. I commit my wife and children to your
care. I will break the lines, follow me.&#8221; He had nothing
in his hands, neither stone nor club nor other weapon.
Rushing forward toward the soldiers he gathered a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of their spears together against his breast and fell
pierced through and through. But he had broken the
ranks of the enemy and made way for his countrymen to
win the battle and to gain their liberty. Switzerland was
saved, and the Swiss patriot did not gather the spears
into his own breast in vain.</p>


<h4>15. THE EMPEROR AND THE GOOSE-BOY</h4>

<p>One hot summer day King Maximilian, of Bavaria,
was walking in the country. Stopping under a tree to
rest, he took a little book from his pocket to read, but
he soon fell asleep. When he awoke he started for home,
and had walked a mile when he thought of the book he
had left under the tree. &#8220;My boy,&#8221; he said to a barefooted
lad who was tending a large flock of geese near-by,
&#8220;if you will run to that oak tree at the second turning
of the road and bring me the book that I left there, I
will give you this gold-piece.&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I would
gladly go, but I cannot leave the geese.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, I will
mind them while you are gone,&#8221; said the King. The boy
laughed. &#8220;I should like to see you minding them,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;why, they would run away from you in a minute.&#8221;
&#8220;Only let me try,&#8221; said the King. At last the boy gave
the King his whip and showed him how to crack it,
and started off. The King sat on a stone and laughed at
the thought of his being a goose-herd. But the geese
missed the boy at once, and with a great cackling and
hissing they went off, half-flying and half-running, across
the field. The King ran after them, trying to crack his
whip and bring them back. But they got into a garden
and were feeding on the tender vegetables when the boy
got back with the book. &#8220;Just as I thought,&#8221; said the
boy, &#8220;I have found your book, and you have lost my
geese.&#8221; The King did the best he could to help the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
drive back the geese into the field. Then he gave the boy
another gold-piece. The boy thanked him and said:
&#8220;You are a very good man, and a very good king; but
you will have to try a long time before you are a very
good goose-herd.&#8221;</p>


<h4>16. THE EMPEROR AND THE SCHOOL CHILDREN</h4>

<p>Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, was walking one
June morning out into the country for a little rest and
recreation. He came to a country schoolhouse, and asked
the teacher if he might speak to the children and ask
them some questions. Taking an orange from his pocket
he said, &#8220;Who can tell me to what kingdom this belongs?&#8221;
A brave, bright boy spoke up quickly and said,
&#8220;It belongs to the vegetable kingdom, sir.&#8221; &#8220;Why?&#8221;
asked the King. &#8220;It is the fruit of a plant, and all plants
belong to the vegetable kingdom,&#8221; said the boy. The
King was pleased. &#8220;You are right, and you shall have
the orange for your answer. Catch it,&#8221; he said, tossing
it to the boy. Then taking a gold coin from his pocket
and holding it up, he said, &#8220;To what kingdom does this
belong?&#8221; Another bright boy answered quickly, &#8220;To the
mineral kingdom, sir! All metals belong to the mineral
kingdom.&#8221; &#8220;That is a good answer,&#8221; said the King.
&#8220;Here is the gold-piece for your answer.&#8221; The children
were delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will ask you one more question,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To what
kingdom do I belong?&#8221; The bright boys were puzzled
now. Some thought of saying &#8220;To the kingdom of
Prussia.&#8221; Some wanted to say &#8220;To the animal kingdom.&#8221;
But they were a little afraid, and all kept still.
At last a tiny, blue-eyed little girl looked up into the
King&#8217;s smiling face and said in her simple way, &#8220;I think
you belong to the kingdom of heaven, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>King Frederick&#8217;s eyes filled with tears, and he stooped
down and kissed the sweet little girl, and said, &#8220;I hope
I may always belong to that kingdom, my child.&#8221;</p>


<h4>17. TOLSTOY&#8217;S DAUGHTER AND THE PEASANT BOY</h4>

<p>One day Count Tolstoy&#8217;s little daughter, ten years old,
was in front of the house playing with some peasant children
of the village. In a quarrel that arose one of the
boys struck the little girl with a stick on her arm, making
it black and blue. She ran in the house crying, and
said to her father: &#8220;That naughty boy has bruised my
arm. I want you to go out and whip him.&#8221; The father
took the little girl on his knee and said: &#8220;My daughter,
tell me, what good would it do if I went out and beat him?
Would not your arm really hurt just as much? He
struck you because he was angry with you. For a few
minutes he hated you. If I whip him he will hate you
more than ever and hate me too, and all of us. Would it
not be better to make him love us? Perhaps that would
change his character for the rest of his life. I tell you
what I would do if I were you. I would go to the pantry
and get some of that nice raspberry jam and take it out to
him, and I think he will be made to love us all, instead of
hating us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl did what her father told her. Such a
spirit of love Tolstoy believed in and taught in all his
writings. Were such a spirit of love shown everywhere
in the world, evil would oftener be overcome by good.</p>


<h4>18. THE WRISTS BOUND WITH THE RED THREAD</h4>

<p>Once the English were at war with some fierce tribes
of India, called the Hillsmen. The English knew they
were very brave, and noticed after every battle the bravest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
chiefs who were killed were found with a red thread
bound around their wrists, as a mark of greatest honor.
One day some English soldiers, following the enemy,
were marching along a narrow valley, far in the hill-country,
when suddenly they came to a place where the valley
was divided by a great pointed boulder. The main regiment
kept to the right. A sergeant and eleven men took
the left, thinking they could easily pass around the boulder
and meet their companions beyond it. But in a moment
the sergeant found that the boulder was an arm of the
left cañon of the valley, and that they had marched into
a deep gorge with no outlet except the way they came.
As they looked up at the great walls they spied a number
of Hillsmen who, from their hiding-places, began showering
spears upon them. Just at that moment the officer in
command of the other soldiers saw the danger of these
men and gave the order for them to retreat. In some
strange way they mistook the signal for a command to
charge. At once they charged on a run up the slope,
cheering as they ran. But as they were eleven against
seventy, some of them were killed by spears, others were
hurled backward over the precipice, and three only got
to the top and fought hand to hand with the foe. When
the fighting was finished two Hillsmen lay dead for every
Englishman. Later in the day the English relief party
arrived and gathered up their dead comrades, and they
found, bound around both wrists of every one, the red
thread! The Hillsmen had given to their foes the honor
reserved for their own heroes.&mdash;<i>Adapted from &#8220;How
to Tell Stories to Children,&#8221; by Sara Cone Bryant.</i></p>


<h4>19. &#8220;LITTLE TEN MINUTES&#8221;</h4>

<p>When the English were at war with the Zulus in South
Africa, a French prince, named Louis Napoleon, enlisted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and one morning was riding outside the camp with a
small company of soldiers. All about them in the open
country they saw the Zulus. One of his friends said:
&#8220;Louis, we had better go back to camp. We are in great
danger here. The Zulus may come upon us any minute
and kill us.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, no danger,&#8221; said the Prince, &#8220;let us
stay here just ten minutes more, and drink our coffee.&#8221;
During that ten minutes the Zulus came upon them, and
in the skirmish the Prince lost his life. When the news
of his death was telegraphed to his widowed mother in
London, England, she said: &#8220;That was always Louis&#8217; way.
When he was a little boy he was never ready on time.
He was always saying, &#8216;Just ten minutes more.&#8217; Sometimes
when I called him in the morning and he was too
sleepy to speak he would lift his hands and spread out
his ten fingers to show that he wanted ten minutes more.
I used to call him &#8216;Little Ten Minutes.&#8217; Those ten
minutes have lost me my boy, and my boy his life. His
fault has become his fate!&#8221;</p>

AMERICAN HISTORICAL STORIES</h3></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Adapted for Children, Six to Twelve Years.</i>)</p>


<h4>1. HOW AMERICA WAS FOUND</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Christopher Columbus</span> was a poor sailor, who
believed that the earth was round like an orange.
Very few people would believe him because almost everybody
living then thought that the earth was flat. Some
men supposed that this big, flat earth was carried upon
the back of a great elephant or on the shoulders of a large
giant. As the ships of those days were small, and the
sailors were superstitious and afraid of the unknown sea,
few mariners had ever sailed far out upon the ocean.
Should one try, they thought he would sail off the edge
of the earth.</p>

<p>Columbus said: &#8220;Give me money to buy ships, and I
will prove the earth is round by sailing around it, just
as a fly can walk around an orange.&#8221; This seemed too
funny for any one to believe. Even the little children
pointed the finger at this sailor and called him crazy. No
one would help him get ships. At last Isabella, Queen of
Spain, said, &#8220;Here are my jewels! Sell them and sail
your ships.&#8221; So Columbus set sail with these ships on
Friday, August 3, 1492, from Spain, with one hundred
and twenty persons on board. They sailed westward
for many days, and the sailors became frightened at the
thought of their distance from home. At last they said
they would throw Columbus overboard if he did not
take them back. He promised if they did not see land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
in three days he would return. During those three days
they could plainly see signs of land. Birds came and
rested on the masts; fresh-water weeds, berry-bushes, and
large branches of trees floated by; and the sailors had
great fun in netting crabs and other shell-fish in the seaweed.
But on the last night, as Columbus with longing
eyes was peering through the darkness, suddenly his heart
gave a quick jump, for he saw a light in the distance that
appeared too bright and low to be a star. It danced up
and down as if a person carried it in his hand while running.
Just at daybreak some one cried, &#8220;Land! Land!&#8221;
Then a cannon from the first ship boomed across the sea,
which was the signal that land was found. The sailors
saw a beautiful green island. There were hundreds of
men running to the shore and throwing up their arms
in fear. They had never seen a ship before. Some
thought they were great birds with white wings. Others
thought the Great Spirit had come. Columbus put on
his rich, scarlet robes, and taking the royal banner of
Spain in his hands, ordered the sailors to row him in a
little boat to the shore. As soon as they reached land,
Columbus and his men fell on their knees, kissed the
ground, and sang praise to God. Columbus thought he
had reached India, so he called the copper-colored men,
with their straight black hair, Indians. This is the name
still given to the natives of North America.</p>


<h4>2. HOW AMERICA WAS NAMED</h4>

<p>Does it not seem strange that this island should be
called &#8220;America,&#8221; instead of &#8220;Columbia,&#8221; when Columbus
discovered it? After all he had done it would have
seemed only fair to have had his name remembered in
the name of the country. But many men were jealous
of him, and a few years later, when he returned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
island, he was seized, bound in chains, carried to the ship,
and returned at once to Spain. Isabella was dead, and
King Ferdinand did nothing to help him. So Columbus,
already an aged man, lived the rest of his days in poverty,
and died broken-hearted. Meanwhile another sailor and
traveler, named Americus Vespucius, made a voyage
across the ocean. When he returned he talked much
of what he had seen, and wrote several books of his
travels. These books were read by some students of
geography in the monastery of St. Die. When one of
these scholars wrote another book describing these travels,
he said the New World should be called &#8220;America&#8221; in
honor of Americus Vespucius, honestly believing him to
have been the first discoverer. It does not seem that
Americus was guilty of making a false claim, or that he
wanted to deprive Columbus of his honor. Had he not
written his books of travel his memory would have faded
away, as has happened to many who were mightier in
deed than they were with the pen. Columbus died before
the book from St. Die was published. Vespucius died six
years after. Both believed that the new country was a
part of the Indies. Very likely Americus never heard of
Waldseemüller, the obscure geographer in the monastery
of St. Die, who had, unintentionally, robbed Columbus
of part of the glory of his discovery and had given
the new world the name of &#8220;America&#8221; instead of
&#8220;Columbia.&#8221;</p>


<h4>3. THE MAN WHO FIRST SAILED AROUND THE WORLD</h4>

<p>Columbus said, &#8220;Give me money to buy ships, and I
will prove that the earth is round by sailing around it.&#8221;
But he never did sail around the earth, after all. Nor did
Americus Vespucius. This was left for another sailor,
named Fernando Magellan. In 1519, twelve years after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the death of Columbus, he started from Spain with a
large fleet of ships, hoping to find, through this new
land, a way by which he might sail around the world.
He sailed directly across the Atlantic Ocean to America,
looking up and down the coast for an opening to the
other ocean which a sailor one day had seen. Finding
no opening, he sailed down to the most southern point of
South America, and after sailing around Cape Horn, he
came out into the great ocean. When he saw it first it
looked smiling and peaceful. So on account of its calm,
sunny appearance, he named it the &#8220;Pacific,&#8221; which
means &#8220;peaceful.&#8221; Sailing over the Pacific Ocean he
came at last to the Indies, to India, and to Spain. Then
he knew that he had sailed around the world. So what
Columbus had said and believed so earnestly, Fernando
Magellan proved at last to be true&mdash;the earth is round!</p>


<h4>4. THE LOST COLONY</h4>

<p>After Columbus discovered America many ships from
Spain, France, and England sailed across the sea, bringing
settlers to plant new homes here. Spain took possession
of Florida; France of Canada; and England claimed
all the land lying between Canada and Florida, and called
it &#8220;Virginia.&#8221; The English sent over a shipload of one
hundred and fifty settlers, who landed on the beautiful
island of Roanoke. When their rough houses were built
and the people had planted their fields and the colony
seemed prosperous, Governor John White resolved to
return home to report their success and to bring new provisions
for them. He did not like to leave because unfriendly
Indians roamed about, and besides, there was a
little baby girl, his granddaughter, named Virginia (who
was the first English child ever born in America), whom
he did not like to leave. But the people needed provisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and so the brave man sailed back to England. It was
three years before his ship returned and he again drew
near the island. Eagerly he looked up and down the
shore for signs of a welcome from his people. But only
the washing of the waves on the beach and the stillness
and gloom of the dense forest greeted him. Not a person
was to be found. His little granddaughter, her parents,
and all the colonists had disappeared. The huts
were deserted. Not a sound was to be heard but the
cry of the birds and the moaning of the trees. On a tree
were cut a few letters. Was it the name of some place
to which the people had moved? Poor John White! He
never found out. Heart-broken, he turned his ship back
to England. Not a trace of this lost colony, not a trace
of the little babe, Virginia Dare, has ever been found.</p>


<h4>5. POCAHONTAS</h4>

<p>Captain John Smith was a brave and wise man who
came from England and settled in Virginia. One day
some of his men disobeyed orders and got into a quarrel
with the Indians. John Smith was taken prisoner and
led into their camp. He showed them his compass, and
told them how the needle always turned to the north,
which so amused the Indians that, instead of killing him,
they took him to their chief, Powhatan, who said, &#8220;The
white man must die.&#8221; He was bound hand and foot, and
an Indian was just raising his war-club to kill him, when
up rushed Pocahontas, a bright Indian girl, the chief&#8217;s
daughter, who threw her arms around John Smith&#8217;s neck
and begged her father to spare him. Powhatan loved
Pocahontas, so the prisoner was released, and even allowed
to return to his own people. Pocahontas became a
good friend of the white men. She was beautiful, and
John Rolfe fell in love with her. After their marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
they went to England, where Pocahontas was everywhere
received with great honor. The king and queen invited
her to their palace, and all loved the gentle Indian princess.
They intended to return to America, but Pocahontas died
in England. Her little son, Thomas Rolfe, was well educated
in England. When he grew up he settled in Virginia.</p>


<h4>6. THE INDIANS&#8217; GUNPOWDER HARVEST</h4>

<p>At first the Indians were very kind to the white men;
but after the white men began to be cruel and hard to
them, they too grew hard and cruel, and nothing was too
terrible for the Indians to do in revenge. They had very
strange ways of carrying on their battles. They never
came out and met their enemy face to face, but would
skulk around behind trees in swamps or in the high grass.
When the white men used guns and gunpowder, the
Indians were terribly frightened, but it was not long before
they themselves learned to use them. One day an
old Indian chief begged some gunpowder from a white
man, and ran away to his wigwam with it. The white
man watched to see what he would do with it. When he
reached his wigwam he called some of his friends about
him, and, after a long council together, they began to
plant the powder. They thought it would grow like corn
and beans. Later a French trader persuaded some Indians
living near the Missouri River to give him skins and furs
in exchange for gunpowder, telling them it was a seed,
which would grow if sown in the ground. The innocent
Indians sowed all they bought, and placed a guard to
protect the fields from wild beasts, going out to the field
from time to time to see if the powder was growing.
When they found out the trick that had been played on
them they waited until the trader&#8217;s partner came to exchange
more goods. Then the Indians who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
tricked into sowing gunpowder gathered, went into his
tent, and each helped himself to what goods he wanted.
Soon the whole stock disappeared. The Frenchman, in
anger, went to the chief, who said, &#8220;Yes, you shall have
justice as soon as the gunpowder harvest is gathered.&#8221;
The Frenchman said, &#8220;Gunpowder grows in France, but
your Missouri land is not good to produce it.&#8221;</p>

<p>All his arguments were in vain. The Indians said,
&#8220;When the gunpowder harvest is reaped then the Frenchman
shall have back his goods.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the French trader returned with less goods and less
money than he went, finding out, when too late, that
Indians, like some other men, can be deceived but once.</p>


<h4>7. THE MAYFLOWER AND THE PILGRIMS</h4>

<p>Over one hundred years after Columbus discovered
America a little ship, the Mayflower, sailed away from
England. About one hundred people came with it, who
were called &#8220;Pilgrims.&#8221; They went first from England
to Holland, and then left their homes across the sea to
find a new home where they would be free to worship
God, and rule themselves in the way they wished. The
tiny Mayflower was tossed like an egg-shell on the rough
waves. It took more than two months for it to cross the
ocean. The storms drove it from its course, so that instead
of landing farther south, as they intended, the Pilgrims
landed at Plymouth. There in the little cabin on
the Mayflower forty-four men signed an agreement to
make good laws and obey them. A little girl was the
first Pilgrim to step off the Mayflower upon the rock
which is now called &#8220;Plymouth Rock.&#8221; As soon as all
had landed, they gathered about that huge boulder, and
kneeling down thanked God for their deliverance from
the perils of the sea. Indians from behind the hilltop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
peeped out at the strange visitors, and then ran away, disappearing
so completely that they were not seen again
for a long time. Two little baby boys were born on the
Mayflower. What funny names they had! One was
called &#8220;Peregrine,&#8221; which means &#8220;wandering,&#8221; and the
other was called &#8220;Oceanus,&#8221; because he was born on the
ocean. Should you ever go to the town of Plymouth you
will find, in Pilgrim Hall, the very cradle in which little
Peregrine White was rocked so many years ago. And
you will see &#8220;Plymouth Rock,&#8221; now carefully sheltered,
near the place where the Pilgrims landed in 1620, on
December 22, which day, each year, is celebrated in
New England as &#8220;Forefathers&#8217; Day.&#8221;</p>

<h4>8. THE FIRST THANKSGIVING DAY</h4>

<p>The Pilgrims lived on the Mayflower until a log house,
large enough for all, was built. This was surrounded by
a high, wooden barricade to keep off the Indians and wild
animals. Afterward the men built a house for each of
the nineteen families. How their axes rang in the winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
air, as they felled the trees for lumber to build these rude
houses! How nobly the wives and mothers worked in
the bitter cold of their uncomfortable homes, washing,
ironing, baking, brewing, pounding the corn, spinning
the cloth, and making everything, singing cheerfully all
the while! How bravely the boys and girls tried to bear
the cold and hunger without complaining, and in all their
little ways helping their parents to build up a village out
of the wild woods! What a hard time they had during
that long and bitter winter! Often they did not have
food enough. Many Pilgrims were taken ill, and one-half
of them died before spring came. One day a kind
Indian, who had learned English from some fishermen
on the coast, suddenly walked out of the woods, saying,
&#8220;Welcome, Englishmen! Welcome, Englishmen!&#8221; The
Indians showed them how to plant corn with a fish or two
in each hill to fertilize it; how to build a birch-bark canoe,
snow-shoes, and moccasins. The Mayflower went to
England and returned with plenty of food. In the summer
fine crops were gathered. So in the fall, about a
year after they had arrived, the Pilgrims had food enough
to last all the next winter. They were happy then and
said, &#8220;Let us thank God.&#8221; So a Thanksgiving meeting
was held. The Pilgrims enjoyed their good dinner of
wild turkey, and invited the friendly Indians to feast with
them.</p>

<h4>9. REBECCA AND THE SNAKE</h4>

<p>All of this country at first was covered with great forests,
except the plains and river-beds. The name &#8220;Pennsylvania&#8221;
means Penn&#8217;s Wood. William Penn wanted to
name the land on which he settled his colony &#8220;Sylvania,&#8221;
from the Latin word &#8220;sylva,&#8221; meaning wood, because it
was covered with woods. But King Charles II, of England,
said, &#8220;No, it shall be called &#8216;Penn&#8217;s Wood&#8217;&mdash;Pennsylvania.&#8221;
In this great forest William Penn laid
out the city of Philadelphia, or &#8220;Brotherly Love,&#8221; which
he wished to make &#8220;a fair and green country town,
where men might dwell together like brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the very first settlers sent over from England
by William Penn was a little girl named Rebecca, who
lived in a house that was simply a cave dug in the bank
of the river. One day, as she sat at the door of the
cave, eating her bowl of milk-porridge, a snake glided
up to her, attracted by the odor of the warm porridge,
for snakes are very fond of milk. The kind-hearted girl
pitied the snake, looking up at her out of its bright eyes,
as much as to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m so hungry.&#8221; &#8220;I will give thee
half of my supper,&#8221; she said, and she began to divide her
porridge with the snake. But the greedy creature wanted
all of it. This Rebecca would not allow. &#8220;Nay, nay,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;thou canst have only thy share; keep to thy part.&#8221;
And although the snake poked its little head again and
again into her dish, she made him withdraw it, and
justly divided the porridge&mdash;a spoonful for the snake and
a spoonful for herself&mdash;until every drop was gone. Then
the snake glided away as silently as he had appeared.
The little Quaker girl never saw him again. But she
never forgot her strange visitor, and as long as she lived
she had pleasure in thinking of the day when she shared
her milk-porridge with a hungry snake.</p>

<h4>10. THE BRIDE WORTH HER WEIGHT IN SILVER</h4>

<p>The first coins used in the American Colonies were
made in England and Spain, but there were so very few
of them that the colonists were compelled to exchange
their goods instead of receiving money. As trade increased
all felt the need of some sort of money. So a
money-law was passed and the kind of coin decided upon.
Captain John Hull was made mint-master. The largest
of these new coins had stamped upon them a picture of a
pine tree, and they were called &#8220;pine-tree shillings.&#8221;
Captain Hull, for his pay, received one shilling out of
every twenty shillings he made, and soon he had a
strong, new chest filled with pine-tree shillings. This
mint-master had a daughter who was a hearty girl, healthy
and plump. A young man fell in love with her, and asked
the captain if she might become his wife. As he was
an industrious, honest, and good young man, her father
consented, saying in his good-natured way, &#8220;You will find
her a rather heavy burden, I am thinking!&#8221; When the
wedding-day came the mint-master was at the ceremony,
dressed in a plum-colored coat, with bright silver buttons
made of pine-tree shillings; and his daughter, the fair
bride, looked as plump and rosy as a big red apple. After
the ceremony was over, Captain Hull told his servants
to bring a great pair of scales. He said, &#8220;Daughter, get
into one side of the scales,&#8221; which she did. Then, pointing
to a big iron chest, he said to his servants, &#8220;Draw
it near the scales.&#8221; He unlocked it, raised the cover, and
everybody was breathless when they saw the chest was
full of bright, shining pine-tree shillings. &#8220;Lively, now,
boys, pour these shillings into the other side of the scale,&#8221;
he said to his servants, laughing as he saw the look of
surprise on the faces of the people. Jingle, jingle went
the shillings as handful after handful was thrown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
until, big and plump as she was, the fair young bride was
lifted from the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, my son,&#8221; said the mint-master to the bridegroom,
&#8220;take these shillings for my daughter&#8217;s sake.
Treat her kindly and thank God for her. It isn&#8217;t every
bride that is worth her weight in silver.&#8221;</p>


<h4>11. EVANGELINE AND THE BURNING OF ACADIA</h4>

<p>America grew until thirteen colonies, like those in
Virginia and at Plymouth, were settled by the English,
along the coast from Maine to Florida. Because they said
Sebastian Cabot had discovered America, England claimed
all the new country westward to the Pacific Ocean. That
included almost all the country there is to-day. The
claims of England led to a bitter war with France, which
was carried on between the French, aided by the Indians,
and the English aided by the colonists. One of the attacks
of this war was made on the French settlement in Acadia,
or Nova Scotia, in the north. The people of the little
village of Grand Pré were peaceful, home-loving families,
who refused to take part in the war on either side, and
would not take the oath of allegiance to England. Because
of this, the English resolved to break up this settlement
and scatter its people&mdash;a heartless plan! One bright
morning the English soldiers in their red coats, came to
the village and, with pretended friendliness, requested the
people to gather into their church to hear a message of
good news. The unsuspecting villagers left their work
and gathered pleasantly into the church. As soon as
they were all gathered, these redcoated British soldiers
seized them, and at the point of the bayonet drove them
like sheep down to the shore, crowded them on board
several British boats, and sailed away. Families were torn
apart; wives lost their husbands; mothers lost their little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
children; brothers and sisters, lovers and maidens were
doomed never to see each other again. The poor people
uttered piteous cries, but the hard-hearted redcoats only
sneered and laughed at their torture. As the ship sailed
out from the harbor, the Acadians saw the soft September
sky all one terrible glare of fire. Then they knew that
their homes were gone, burned in the flames. This the
cruel soldiers had done so that these Acadians might not
try to wander back to their old homes. Seven thousand
of these unhappy people were dropped here and there
from the British vessels, being distributed among the
Colonies that there might be no possibility of their reuniting.
Longfellow tells of how Evangeline was separated
from Gabriel, her lover, on their wedding-day, and
how Gabriel was carried far away to the southland. Beautiful
Evangeline set out on a long search for him&mdash;wandering
on, and on, all her life, and at last, when she
had grown old in her search, found her lover in a hospital
on his dying bed, which proved so great a shock to her that
she too died. The story of Evangeline&#8217;s womanly devotion
is the one ray of light in all that dark and terrible
tragedy of the burning of Acadia by which an entire people
was blotted out, never to be restored again.</p>


<h4>12. THE FIRST COLLEGE IN AMERICA</h4>

<p>The people in the thirteen English Colonies soon began
to call themselves Americans, one and all. Those in New
England especially valued education. It was considered
ridiculous to educate a girl, but there were soon nine colleges
for boys. There was a printing-press in Cambridge,
a public library in New York, a little manufacturing in
Massachusetts, and quite a little commerce all along the
coast. Most of the traveling was done on horseback,
though there were some stage routes. Steam-cars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
automobiles were unheard of. Next to their churches the
people of New England loved their schools. The city of
Boston had been settled only six years when one day
the governor of Massachusetts received a letter from his
sister in England, who refused to come to America because
there was no college where her son could be educated.
In her letter she said: &#8220;If only there were some
place of learning for youths, it would make me go far
nimbler to New England, if God should call me to it, than
I otherwise should; and I believe a college would put no
small life into the plantation.&#8221; This letter set the governor
thinking and planning, and very soon he convinced
those in control that a college should be established. The
money was raised, and Harvard College was built. This
little red, square building, that has stood in Cambridge
for over two hundred years, was the first college in
America.</p>


<h4>13. THE BOSTON TEA PARTY</h4>

<p>The thirteen colonies along the coast obeyed the laws of
England, and were proud of the &#8220;Mother Land,&#8221; as
they called England, until the new king, George III,
made the colonists pay taxes on the goods they received
from England. They felt this was wrong so long as they
had no part in deciding what taxes they should pay, and
had no representation in the law-making. &#8220;We are no
slaves, or children! We have rights, and our rights should
be respected,&#8221; they said. The king replied, &#8220;The
Americans shall pay a tax only on tea.&#8221; In anger the
colonists said: &#8220;We will never drink tea, if we have to
pay a tax upon it. We will drink tea made of sage and
raspberry leaves first.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Charleston the tea was taken off the ships and
left in damp cellars to spoil because no one would buy it.
New York and Philadelphia did not even allow the tea-ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to land; and when they sailed into Boston Harbor,
the people held a great meeting in Faneuil Hall and in
South Church. Samuel Adams and John Hancock, their
leaders, made grand speeches. Some one cried out, &#8220;I
wonder how the tea would taste with salt water?&#8221; This
made everybody laugh. But that night fifty men, dressed
up and painted like Indians, went out to the harbor, rowed
out to the tea-ships and threw overboard three hundred
and forty-two chests of tea into the sea. The next morning
the tea was seen washed up on the shore. When the
colonists heard of this Tea Party all were happy&mdash;but
King George said, &#8220;The leaders shall die for this!&#8221; And
that was the beginning of the war of the Revolution.</p>


<h4>14. PAUL REVERE&#8217;S RIDE</h4>

<p>One of the leaders in the Boston Tea Party, on December
16, 1773, was Paul Revere. He was a copper-plate
engraver in Boston, greatly interested in the rights
of the colonists. When the King of England heard how
the people of Boston had treated his tea, he ordered
Boston Harbor to be closed, not allowing ships to go in
or out. He also forbade their holding town meetings lest
they should talk and plan mischief against him, and he
determined to hang the leaders of the tea-party, if he
could catch them. He appointed a new governor, who
at once asked the king for more soldiers, which were sent.
The Boston people watched these soldiers closely, and
had spies to find out all their plans. One of these spies
was Paul Revere. Secretly the Americans stored guns
and powder and bullets at Concord, about twenty miles
from Boston. They were afraid the British would march
from Boston and take these stores which were for their
use in case of trouble. Samuel Adams and John Hancock
had gone to Lexington because they were not safe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Boston. So the new general secretly ordered eight hundred
soldiers to go and arrest these two leaders at Lexington
and take the supplies from Concord. When Paul Revere
learned of this plan he told a friend to watch their
movements. If they started to go by land, his friend was
to hang one lantern in the tower of Old North Church. If
they went by boat he was to hang up two lanterns. Then
Paul Revere silently rowed across the river and saddled
his horse ready to start. He saw that every strap and
buckle was in place, and quietly waited for the light. At
last he thought he saw a spark, so he sprang into the
saddle. Then he waited a little. Yes, there were two
lights in the old bell-tower. They were going by sea.
Off he dashed, faster and faster, over bridges and through
towns, stopping at every house to cry out, &#8220;Awake, the
British are coming!&#8221; A bell rang out at Lexington to
help arouse the people. The &#8220;Minute Men&#8221; from all the
country round came with their guns. When the British
got there they found their secret was out. Just at sunrise
the redcoats met the &#8220;Minute Men.&#8221; The English
major cried, &#8220;Disperse!&#8221; They did not move. He then
commanded his soldiers to fire. Eight were killed. Men
with muskets sprang up on all sides. This was the first
battle of the great Revolutionary war that made America
free from England. Through all our history to the last,
the American people will never forget</p>

<h4>15. NATHAN HALE</h4>

<p>Nathan Hale, a young man of twenty, had just graduated
from Yale College, and was a school-teacher in Connecticut
when the war of Independence began. At once
he enlisted in the American army, saying, &#8220;Let us not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
lay down our arms till we have gained independence.&#8221;
When General Washington moved his army from Boston
to Brooklyn, Nathan Hale, early one morning, when it
was darkest, rowed out with a few friends to an English
supply ship and sailed it away from the man-of-war that
was guarding it and brought it in safety to the American
camp. For this brave deed he was promoted to become
&#8220;Captain&#8221; Hale. Soon after this a call was made for a
volunteer for a most dangerous service. The British held
possession of the lower part of New York City, and were
planning a further advance, and Washington greatly
needed to know their plans. It was agreed to send a spy
to get these. But who would volunteer? &#8220;I will undertake
it,&#8221; said Captain Hale. He walked fifty miles up
Long Island Sound, along the Connecticut shore and then
rowed over to Long Island. Disguised as a traveling
school-teacher, he visited all the English camps, making
drawings and notes which he hid in his shoes. On his
way back he was betrayed by a man who knew him, a
traitor to the American cause. He was taken on board
the English ship, carried back to New York and led
before General Howe. The English general said: &#8220;You
shall be pardoned and receive money and a fine position
in the English army if you will give up the American
cause.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I cannot turn against my country!&#8221;
&#8220;Then you can die for her,&#8221; said the general, and sentenced
him to die at daybreak. He listened to his sentence
without a word, erect and fearless. At break of day the
young spy, brave as a lion, faced his death without a
tremor.</p>

<p>In City Hall Park, New York City, not far from the
jail in which he was kept that last night, and as near
as possible to the spot where he died, is the statue of
this noble, young patriot-martyr, who in such heroic unselfishness
laid down all he possessed for his country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Upon the statue you will read his last words: &#8220;I regret
that I have but one life to give for my country.&#8221;</p>


<h4>16. GENERAL REED AND THE BRIBE</h4>

<p>General Joseph Reed was a prominent American officer
in the Revolutionary war. He was a man of great influence
and loyal to the interests of his country. The
English officers were anxious to secure some one who
would be a traitor to the American cause of liberty and
who would serve them. One day Governor Johnson, one
of the three Commissioners of King George III, came
to Joseph Reed and whispered secretly: &#8220;I will give you
fifty thousand dollars and a public office besides, under
the British Government, if you will agree to promote the
British interests.&#8221; General Reed replied quickly: &#8220;I am
not worth purchasing; but such as I am, the King of
Great Britain is not rich enough to buy me!&#8221;</p>

<p>No wonder that such a patriot, loyal to honor and to
his country, was admired even among those who offered
the bribe, while that other general, Benedict Arnold, who
actually received the bribe to betray his country, has
ever since been despised by Englishmen as well as by
Americans.</p>


<h4>17. THE FIRST FOURTH OF JULY</h4>

<p>After the Battle of Lexington swift messengers rode
in all directions over the land telling the tidings that the
struggle for American independence was begun. The
news set the people aflame with excitement. Men
dropped whatever they had in hand to join the little army
under George Washington, who was elected general of
the American soldiers. The colonists now believed that
nothing but liberty would save them. Men like Patrick
Henry of Virginia said, &#8220;Give me liberty or give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
death!&#8221; So, on July 4, 1776, at the State House in
Philadelphia, the Declaration of Independence, prepared
by Thomas Jefferson, was discussed. Above the State
House where they met hung a great bell. The old bell-ringer
sat there ready to ring the bell the moment the
declaration was signed. His little grandson was at the
foot of the stairs to tell him when to ring. The old man
waited and waited. At last he heard the little boy running
up the stairs, shouting, &#8220;Ring, grandpa! Ring,
grandpa! Ring for liberty!&#8221; The old man took hold of
the bell-rope, and the glad news of liberty rang out over
the city. The bell was kept ringing for two hours. The
crowds in the street shouted, &#8220;We are free!&#8221; &#8220;We are
free!&#8221; Flags were waved, bonfires were lighted; parades
were formed; speeches were made; and, as the news
spread, the joy increased everywhere! That was the first
Fourth of July.</p>


<h4>18. WASHINGTON&#8217;S CHRISTMAS VICTORY</h4>

<p>It was the winter of the year in which the Declaration
of Independence was signed, 1776, when Washington,
with his little army of three thousand patriots, beaten,
and driven out of Brooklyn, out of New York, out of
New Jersey, finally crossed the Delaware River, at the
same hour that General Cornwallis, the most skilful of all
the British leaders, with a much larger army, reached
Trenton. The cold was intense. The patriots were in rags;
many were barefooted, and the route was marked by their
footprints of blood. Congress was fleeing in panic from
Philadelphia to Baltimore. Terror spread everywhere,
and many Americans hastened to put themselves under
British protection. But amid all, Washington never lost
his courage. Having seized all the boats along the Delaware,
for many miles up and down the river, he intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
to surprise the Hessian soldiers (whom the English had
hired) at Trenton on Christmas night when he knew they
would be sure to be spending their time in feasting and
merriment. Amid a storm of sleet and snow, bitterly cold,
on Christmas evening, Washington and twenty-five hundred
picked men pushed their flatboats through the grinding
blocks of ice, and during the night the entire force
landed on the other side of the Delaware, and before the
bleak, wintry morning dawned, they had surrounded
Trenton. The garrison of one thousand Hessian soldiers
was surprised and captured, with the loss of but four
Americans. Colonel Rall, the Hessian commander, being
wounded and suffering greatly, limped slowly up to where
Washington was seated on his horse and handed him his
sword, begging him to be merciful to the captured men.
Washington gave the promise, expressing his sympathy
with the wounded officer, upon whom he called after he
was carried to a house and laid upon a bed, and spent
some time in trying to cheer his last moments. This
Battle of Trenton did what Washington intended&mdash;electrified
the despairing patriots, increased enlistments, and
inspired hope throughout the land. It was the turning-point
of the Revolution. It was Washington&#8217;s Christmas
gift to the American people.</p>


<h4>19. THE HEROINE OF NORTH CAROLINA</h4>

<p>One summer day when the wild red roses of North
Carolina were in bloom around her door-step, Mistress
Ashe stood at her opened door, and shading her eyes, saw
a cloud of dust that grew larger until an English army
was seen coming nearer and nearer. &#8220;Look,&#8221; cried her
sister, &#8220;at the head of the column rides that braggart.
Colonel Tarleton! Have you heard of the threefold oath
that he registered recently on the banks of the Roanoke in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Virginia?&#8221; &#8220;No, tell me in all haste,&#8221; answered Mrs.
Ashe, &#8220;for they are now almost within ear-shot.&#8221; &#8220;He
swore,&#8221; said the sister, &#8220;that he will plant the flag of old
England on every housetop in our land; if not on the
turret, then on the ashes of every building. He swore that
he will carry our noble leader, General Washington, in
chains to England. He swore that he will quaff a
stirrup-cup (a lucky drink) to these horrid accomplishments
from the Ashe punch-bowl.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of tramping deadened her voice. As the
army came up General Leslie graciously asked the defenseless
women for food and drink, which were brought
at once and placed on the mahogany table. While they
were eating and drinking, Colonel Tarleton, without hint
of his oath, led the talk to the famous Ashe punch-bowl.
He told General Leslie how it was old in England before
the Pilgrims came; how in America it had grown thrice
precious to its owner, because almost every American
leader of the Revolution had quaffed delightful draughts
from its crystal depths; how five officers of the Revolutionary
army, all of the one name and blood of Ashe,
had gathered around that bowl. And then, turning to
Mrs. Ashe he said: &#8220;Mistress Ashe, since you have so
amply entertained your foes, can you not add to your hospitality,
I pray you, a draught from the Ashe punch-bowl?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashe ordered the punch-bowl to be filled, and rich
red roses to be brought to crown it, but she trembled to
think if this cunning colonel succeeded in quaffing a lucky-drink
to his declared designs from that bowl, destruction
indeed might await her country and its leaders. She
arose from her seat at the head of the table. General
Leslie and his officers arose with her. Then she said:
&#8220;General Leslie, from this bowl the brave and the bravest
have sipped, and to such, whether friend or foe, I give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
a draught from this bowl.&#8221; She then handed the General
a glass of the brew, and, while he held his glass in his
hand, waiting the filling of the other glasses, she took
the roses from the bowl and put them in her hair, and then
she turned to Colonel Tarleton: &#8220;Sir, I have heard of your
threefold oath&mdash;that you have sworn to plant the flag
of England on the roof of every American house or on its
ruins; that you have sworn to carry our leader, Washington,
in chains to the foot of your English throne; and
that you have sworn to drink your stirrup-cup, before you
ride forth on the accomplishment of these intents, from
the Ashe punch-bowl.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, then she continued:
&#8220;Heaven grant that our leaders in war may become our
rulers in peace!&#8221; While saying this she put her slender
hands about the heavy bowl, lifted it high above her head,
and then dashed the punch-bowl to the floor. &#8220;Never,
Colonel Tarleton,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;never from the Ashe
punch-bowl shall cup be offered to the cruel foeman of
my people!&#8221; The bowl was broken into a hundred pieces
and the floor was sprinkled as with crimson blood. Outside
the door the red roses blossomed in the sunlight, but
nevermore would any of them crown rich libations in the
once priceless, now shattered, punch-bowl of the Ashes
of North Carolina.</p>


<h4>20. THE HEROINE OF OHIO</h4>

<p>In a little village in Ohio, on the banks of the Ohio
River, there was a large fort called Fort Henry, which
belonged to the colonists. When the Indians, who were
fighting on the side of the English, attacked the village,
all the men, women, and children fled to the fort. The
Indians then attacked the fort, and all the men who went
out to fight them were killed or taken prisoners. At last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
only twelve men were left in the fort to protect the
women and children. When the colonists began to prepare
for the second attack, they found their supply of
powder almost exhausted, and without powder they knew
death was near. Captain Zane called the twelve men
together and said: &#8220;In my house there is a keg of powder.
I do not wish to order any man to go for it, as it is a very
dangerous thing to do, but I would like to have some one
offer to go.&#8221; Several young men at once volunteered.
&#8220;It means almost certain death,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;I
know that,&#8221; replied one young man, &#8220;but we must have
the powder. To stay means death to all.&#8221; Just then the
captain&#8217;s sister, Elizabeth, a girl of fourteen, stepped forward.
&#8220;I will go for the powder,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you cannot
spare one of the men, they are all wanted to protect the
fort. If we are captured by the Indians, I shall surely
be killed. So please let me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Captain Zane said, &#8220;No! No!&#8221; But he soon
saw she was right; not a man could be spared. The gate
of the fort opened and the girl ran quickly out. The
Indians saw her and cried in surprise, &#8220;A squaw! a
squaw!&#8221; but no Indian tried to shoot her. She entered
the house and found the keg of powder, but it was too
heavy for her to carry, so, girllike, she emptied the powder
into her apron, and started back amid the firing of the
Indians, but although their arrows whistled over her head,
she ran swiftly on and reached the gate in safety.</p>

<p>With the help of the powder the colonists were able to
keep the Indians away that night. The next morning
more men came and the Indians were driven away, and
so the colonists of Ohio won a great victory.</p>

<p>The story of this fight at Fort Henry is often told, and
the name of Elizabeth Zane, the brave girl who carried
the apronful of powder to the men in the fort, will be
remembered as long as brave deeds shall be told.</p>

<h4>21. PUTNAM AND THE WOLF</h4>

<p>Israel Putnam, as a boy, lived with his father on a
farm in Connecticut when wolves were still there. Every
winter an old mother wolf would come with a family
of young wolves with her. The hunters always killed
the young wolves, but could not catch the mother. One
winter this old wolf killed seventy sheep and goats in one
night. All the farmers started out to find her. They
saw her track in the snow and after a long hunt their
dogs drove her into a cave. They sent the dogs into the
cave, but the wolf bit them and drove them out again.
Then they put straw in the cave and set fire to it to
smoke her out. It made the wolf sneeze, but she would
not come out. Then Israel Putnam said, &#8220;I will go down
into the cave and bring her out.&#8221; So they tied a rope
to his legs and let him down into the cave. He held in
his hand a burning piece of birch-bark, for he knew wild
animals are afraid to face fire. He crawled along on his
hands and knees in the narrow cave, holding the blazing
bark, until he could see the wolf&#8217;s eyes. The wolf gave a
sudden growl. Putnam jerked the rope and the men
pulled him out quickly. He was badly scratched by the
rocks and his clothes torn, but he got his gun and went
in again. This time the wolf growled and snapped
angrily, but he shot the wolf and brought her out dead.
The sheep had peace after that.</p>


<h4>22. BOONE AND HIS SWING</h4>

<p>Daniel Boone was an early settler in Kentucky. He
knew all about the woods and the ways of the animals
and the Indians. Almost all the men that went with
him into Kentucky were killed by the wild wolves or the
savage Indians. One day when Daniel Boone was left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
alone in his cabin, four Indians came to kill him. He
made his escape over a hill, but the Indians ran after
him. He ran as fast as he could till he reached a wild
grape-vine, which he saw reached to the top of a high
tree, and was long enough to swing over a steep ravine.
When he was a boy he had often made a swing of a wild
grave-vine like this. So he quickly cut the vine off near
the roots, took hold of it and swung out into the air
with all his might. He was carried far out as he swung
over the ravine. Then he let go, and as soon as he fell
to the ground he ran away in a direction in which he
knew the Indians could not find him. When the Indians
came up to the place they could not find his tracks anywhere.
So Daniel Boone was saved by a swing.</p>


<h4>23. KIT CARSON AND THE BEARS</h4>

<p>Kit Carson knew all about wild animals. He was a
great hunter and a good guide to soldiers and settlers.
On a march one day, as he was dragging an elk he had
just shot for supper, he saw two bears running toward
him. His gun was empty. He threw it down, ran as
fast as he could, and reached a tree just as the bears
reached him. He caught hold of a branch and swung
himself up in the tree just in time. Bears know how to
climb trees, and soon they were climbing up in the lower
branches. Kit Carson broke off a limb, and from the
highest branch, where he hung, he began clubbing the
bears over the nose, their tender spot. &#8220;Whack!
Whack!&#8221; The stick hurt, and the bears whined and
growled with pain. First one bear and then the other
tried to get at him, but each got his nose hurt. When
their noses felt better they tried again. But Kit Carson
pounded faster and harder than ever. One of the bears
cried like a baby. Then both bears got down and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
away and never came back again. They were too busy
rubbing their noses.</p>


<h4>24. THE HEROINE OF GETTYSBURG</h4>

<p>One morning in the awful days of the Civil War the
boys in blue and the boys in gray met together for their
decisive battle near the little town of Gettysburg, Pa.
Hearing that this town was to be the center of the battle,
a neighbor ran into a little red-brick cottage and cried,
&#8220;Jennie, you must remove your folks at once.&#8221; &#8220;Hush,
hush!&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;there&#8217;s a little new-born baby
and its mother in the next room, and they cannot be
moved whatever happens.&#8221; &#8220;Why girl, the shells will
crash through these brick walls as through paper!&#8221; said
the man. &#8220;No matter, my sister and her babe cannot be
moved, and I must stay here with mother to care for
them,&#8221; replied Jennie, and the neighbor hastened sadly
away.</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp, tramp, marched regiment after regiment
in turn belonging to both sides, as they passed the little
cottage, and Jennie noticed that every soldier&#8217;s eye rested
eagerly on the windlass of the well in front of the little
red-brick cottage, for the July sun shone hot in the sky.
&#8220;They are thirsty,&#8221; said Jennie, as she filled the old oaken
bucket from the well, and brought out every dipper and
ladle and cup she could find for the soldiers to fill their
canteens or to drink as they hurriedly tramped by. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad I did not go away,&#8221; she said; &#8220;there is something
I can do here to help others.&#8221; And so she helped all she
could until the troops had passed by for the battle. Later
in the day the tide of the battle turned. The boys in gray
reached the ridge and captured the town of Gettysburg.
Then the boys in blue, on the run, retreated, moaning and
groaning as they rushed past the little red-brick house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
which now became the very center of the battle. Cannon,
like thunder, shook the ground. Bullets, like hailstones,
fell around them. Balls crashed through windows and
walls as through paper, as the neighbor had said. The
space around the well was strewn with the dead and
dying. Hungry men begged for bread and the brave girl
gave everything she had until she had not a crumb left.
Then she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make some bread.&#8221; But scarcely
were the loaves in the oven before a loud knock was heard
at the door, and a soldier-boy stood there pleading, &#8220;I&#8217;m
so hungry. Give me a bit of bread.&#8221; It would be three
hours before the bread was baked, but biscuit would soon
be ready, she thought. She quickly took up the dough
and was remixing it to make biscuits, when whizz! a rifle-ball
crashed through the open door, striking the girl in
the breast, and she fell to the floor dead!</p>

<p>That night they buried Jennie Wade, with the dough
still in her hands&mdash;buried her as thousands were buried,
on the field of Gettysburg, without ceremony. Should you
visit her grave in the little cemetery there, on her tombstone
you would see these words: &#8220;Jennie Wade, died
aged nineteen. She hath done what she could!&#8221;</p>


<h4>25. HOBSON AND THE MERRIMAC</h4>

<p>When the United States was at war with Spain in
1898, a Spanish fleet crossed the Atlantic and sailed into
Santiago Bay. Commodore Schley at once sailed his
squadron of ships there to prevent the escape of the
Spanish fleet, and he was soon joined by Rear-admiral
Sampson, who took charge of the whole American fleet.
The entrance to Santiago Bay is so long and narrow,
that, knowing it was full of mines and protected by forts
on either side, the American Government would not allow
Sampson&#8217;s fleet to try to force an entrance. So all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
ships could do was to shell the forts along the coast and
keep watch day and night. The Americans knew that if
a storm arose and their ships should be obliged to run
out to sea, the Spanish admiral would take advantage of
it and run out of the harbor and possibly attack some of
the ill-defended coast towns. The navy was very anxious
to find a way of blocking the harbor so that the Spanish
fleet could not get out. Admiral Sampson decided to run
the Merrimac into the channel at night, swing it across
the narrow point and sink it there, thus making a barrier
which could not easily be removed. &#8220;Who will undertake
this service of sinking the Merrimac?&#8221; was the
question, and immediately there were far more men than
could be used. Naval Constructor Hobson, with some
brave volunteers, was assigned the task, which seemed
in all probability to mean certain death. At three o&#8217;clock
in the morning the Merrimac entered the narrow channel
and steamed in under the guns of the great Morro Castle.
The stillness of the night was broken by the wash of a
small patrol boat approaching from the shore. The boat
ran close up under the stern of the Merrimac and fired
several shots, one of which carried away the rudder. In
a moment the guns from the Spanish ships and forts were
turned upon the Merrimac; and although torpedoes exploded
all around them, and mines went off under them,
Hobson coolly gave his orders. The torpedoes were
touched off, and as the Merrimac sank, he and his men
were swept overboard into the chilling waters. There,
escaping death as by a miracle, they clung to an old raft.
When the Merrimac sank the Spaniards cheered wildly,
thinking they had sunk an American ship trying to steal
into the harbor unseen. Many boats pushed out from
the shore to examine the wreck. A Spanish launch came
toward the raft. Hobson and his men agreed to capture
this boat and run away. But just as she came close the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
heads of half a dozen Spanish soldiers peeped up and each
man pointed his rifle at the heads of the Americans. &#8220;Is
there any officer in that boat to receive a surrender of
prisoners of war?&#8221; Hobson shouted. An old man leaned
out under the awning and waved his hand. It was Admiral
Cervera. The soldiers lowered their rifles, and the
prisoners were helped into the launch. Hobson and his
brave companions spent more than a month in Spanish
prisons, but at length an exchange of prisoners made it
possible for them to be returned in safety, and ever since
the story of Hobson and the sinking of the Merrimac has
been told as one of the most heroic deeds in the history
of modern times.</p>


<h4>26. BETSY ROSS AND THE FLAG</h4>

<p>Americans who have lived some time in other countries
say that when they see the American flag floating
from the mast of a ship in a foreign land a lump rises
in the throat and &#8220;the Stars and Stripes,&#8221; with its bright
red, white, and blue, seems to be the most beautiful
emblem in all the world. Do you know how it was first
made, and why? When George Washington was leading
his soldiers in the war for liberty, he felt that the new
nation needed a flag. He said: &#8220;We must have a flag,
one flag for all the Colonies.&#8221; Every country needs a flag
to float over the homes of its people, to carry in parades,
to wave on the masts of the ships at sea and in foreign
harbors, and to inspire its citizens and soldiers to patriotism.
At first there had been flags of all kinds among the
colonists, the commonest having a rattlesnake upon it,
with the motto, &#8220;Don&#8217;t tread on me,&#8221; and another, called
the Union flag (with stripes as at present, and the double
cross of the British flag instead of stars), was unfurled
for the first time on New Year&#8217;s Day, 1776, at Cambridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
The matter of a new flag for the new people was talked
over, and on June 14, 1777, by a resolution of Congress,
it was decided upon. Washington, assisted by a committee,
drew a picture of the flag he wanted&mdash;one with
thirteen stripes to represent the thirteen States that had
fought for freedom. These stripes were to be one red
and one white. On a field of blue in the corner, near
the staff, there were to be thirteen stars. Then, of course,
those men knew they must find a woman to make the flag.
The men could plan for it, but a woman must make it.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia there lived a young woman named
Betsy Ross, who, with her husband, kept a small furniture
and upholstering shop, and who did a great deal of sewing.
She sewed beautifully, and had often been hired to
make flags for the river-boats and other kinds of boats.
One day, as she sat sewing in her shop, she heard a knock
at her door. She opened it, and there stood George
Washington and another gentleman. The general showed
her a picture of the flag he wanted with its stripes and
six-pointed stars. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that will not do.
The stars must be prettier than those. A correct star
has only five points.&#8221; She quickly folded up a piece of
paper just right and with one snip of her scissors clipped
the paper, and there was a beautiful five-pointed star.
Washington was greatly pleased with the star and also
with the skilful fingers of Betsy Ross, and so she was
given the order for the first American flag. This first
flag was made the next day in the little shop, still standing
at 239 Arch Street, Philadelphia, where she continued
to carry on the flag business many years after the death
of her husband, who was wounded during the war while
guarding some military stores. Her children succeeded
her in the business at her death. Since the first flag with
its thirteen stripes and thirteen stars, there has been added
a new star for every State admitted to the Union.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>One of the first American war vessels, named the Reprisal,
is said to have been the first vessel that, in 1777,
carried &#8220;Old Glory&#8221; on the ocean. Ever since, whenever
this American flag has floated in the air, its message
has been, &#8220;America, the land of the free.&#8221; Its red sings,
&#8220;Be brave&#8221;; its blue says, &#8220;Be true&#8221;; its white means,
&#8220;Be pure.&#8221;</p>


<h4>27. THE MAN WHO WROTE &#8220;AMERICA&#8221;</h4>

<p>The beautiful hymn, &#8220;America,&#8221; our national anthem,
which is loved and sung all over our land, and all over the
world wherever the Stars and Stripes is honored, was
composed by Dr. Samuel Francis Smith. He was born in
Boston, Mass., October 21, 1808. In childhood he lived
not far from the Old North Church. When he looked
up at the tower in which Paul Revere hung the lantern,
perhaps there came into his heart that love for his country
which years afterward he put into his song. One
holiday when his grandmother was coming on a visit to
his home, he stood at the window, expecting she would
bring him a present. When she came without a present
the little fellow said solemnly, &#8220;All days are alike!&#8221; He
was so obedient that when he went out to play he would
ask, &#8220;How many slides may I take, mother?&#8221; And when
he had taken just the number his mother told him, he
would come in.</p>

<p>When Samuel was eight years old a pet cat belonging
to one of the neighbors died, and was buried in the garden.
The next morning the owners of the cat found on its
grave a stick with a piece of paper fastened to it, and
on the paper some verses. This was his first poem. At
twelve he wrote another, and after that, many more. He
went to what is now the Eliot School in North Bennett
Street, Boston, where he won the gold medal. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
there he went to the Boston Latin School, and there,
also, he won the medal. Then to Harvard, and to the
Andover Theological Seminary. He graduated from
Harvard in 1829, in the class with Dr. Oliver Wendell
Holmes, who sang of him in his poem, &#8220;The Boys&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And there&#8217;s a nice youngster of excellent pith,</div>
<div class="verse">Fate tried to conceal him by calling him Smith,</div>
<div class="verse">But he shouted a song for the Brave and the Free,</div>
<div class="verse">Just read on his medal, &#8220;My Country, of Thee.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Doctor Holmes wrote further: &#8220;The name of Dr.
Samuel F. Smith will be honored by every school child
in the land when I have been forgotten one hundred years.
He wrote &#8216;My Country.&#8217; If he had said &#8216;Our Country,&#8217;
the hymn would not have been remembered, but that
&#8216;My&#8217; was a master-stroke. Every one who sings it
at once feels a personal ownership in his native land.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the senior year at Andover Seminary, in 1832,
W. C. Woodridge, a friend of young Smith, brought
from Germany a book of patriotic songs and said, &#8220;Please
make me a poetical translation.&#8221; As this young senior
and poet was turning over the leaves of the song-book he
came across the air of an easy patriotic tune which pleased
him. As he was translating &#8220;God Save the King,&#8221; taken
with the words, he thought how fine it would be to
have an American patriotic anthem. Under the impulse
of the moment he picked up a scrap of waste paper and
his quill pen and began to write, and in half an hour the
four verses of the poem, &#8220;America,&#8221; were written as they
stand to-day. Later his friend Lowell Mason saw the
poem, liked it, and put it into his music-book, and it has
floated around the world. Doctor Smith said he heard it
sung above the earth, on Pike&#8217;s Peak, and under the
earth, in the Cave of the Winds, and on the earth in a
great many lands. It was first sung publicly at a Sunday-school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
celebration, in the Park Street Church, Boston, and
since, in days of peace and prosperity, through the
crisis of the Civil War, and on almost all public occasions,
it has gradually won recognition as our national anthem,
without the ceremonial of adoption in any historic sense.
Public-school teachers find it most helpful in awakening
a love for the new country among the mixed races of
child immigrants who must be molded into patriotic
American citizens. In association with Lowell Mason,
Doctor Smith wrote the first song-book for boys and girls
ever published in the United States. It is remarkable
that the national anthems of America, of England, and of
Prussia should have the same tune. Henry Carey is often
credited with this tune. The English, however, did not invent
it. The Germans got it from the Norsemen, who had
heard it sung by Finns, who got it from Huns, who
brought it from Asia. Something like it was sung by the
Jews in the first temple, and it may have come from the
Egyptians. It is a solemn and majestic strain, suitable
to some of the Psalms of David:</p>

HEROES OF PEACE</h3></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Adapted for Children, Nine to Fourteen Years.</i>)</p>


<h4>1. THE BOY HERO OF HOLLAND</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Once</span> there was a good boy who had a kind-hearted
mother. One afternoon she said: &#8220;Here, Peter, are
some cakes I want you to take to the poor old blind man
who is very ill, and who lives a mile and a half away from
town. If you go quickly and do not stop to play, you
will be home before it is dark.&#8221; Peter took the cakes to
the poor old blind man, who said, &#8220;You are a kind-hearted
boy; thank your mother for me.&#8221; Light-hearted
because he had made the blind man happy, Peter was
walking home when suddenly he noticed a little stream
of water trickling through the great bank on the side
of the road. This was in Holland, where much of the
land is below the level of the sea, and where dikes are
built by the people to keep back the sea. Every boy in
Holland knows the danger of even a small leak in the
dike. Peter understood at once that this tiny stream
would soon make a large hole and the whole city would
be flooded. In a moment he saw what he must do. He
climbed down the side of the dike and thrust his chubby
little hand and finger into the tiny hole and stopped the
flowing of the water. Then he cried out for help, but no
one heard him; no one came to help. It grew dark,
and cold; he was hungry; his arm ached and it began to
grow stiff and numb. He shouted again: &#8220;O mother!
mother!&#8221; But his mother thought Peter must be spending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
the night with the blind man, and did not know of
his danger. Peter thought how warm and cozy all at
home were sleeping in their beds, and he said to himself,
&#8220;I will not let them be drowned!&#8221; So that good boy
stayed there all night long, holding back the water. Early
next morning, a minister on his way to visit the sick,
heard a groan, saw the boy, and called out to him, &#8220;What
is the matter, my boy? Are you hurt? Why are you
sitting there?&#8221; When Peter told him what he had done,
the minister said, &#8220;I will hold my hand there while you
run quickly to the town and get help.&#8221; Very soon men
came and repaired the leak in the dike, but all knew that
Peter, by his courage and faithfulness, had saved the
town of Haarlem that night.</p>


<h4>2. THE GERMAN PATRIOT AND THE BARLEY-FIELDS</h4>

<p>Once there was a terrible battle in Germany, and thousands
of soldiers were scattered over the country. A captain
who had many men and horses to feed was told by his
colonel to get food from the farmers near-by. The captain
walked for some time through the broad valley, and
at last knocked at the door of a small cottage. A man,
old and lame and leaning on a stick, opened the door.
&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;Will you please
show me a field where my soldiers can cut grain for our
army? We cannot pay for it.&#8221; The old man led the
soldiers through the valley for about a mile, when they
saw a field of rich barley waving in the breeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what we want,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;No,
not yet,&#8221; said the old man; &#8220;follow me a little farther.&#8221;
After some time they came to a second field of barley.
The soldiers got off their horses, cut the grain, tied the
sheaves, and rode away with them. Then the captain said
to the old man, &#8220;Why did you make us come so far?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
The first field of barley was better than this one.&#8221; &#8220;That
is true, sir,&#8221; answered the old man, &#8220;but it was not
mine!&#8221;&mdash;<i>Adapted from &#8220;Ethics for Children&#8221; by E. L.
Cabot.</i></p>


<h4>3. THE JAPANESE AND THE EARTHQUAKE</h4>

<p>Once in far-away Japan there lived a rich man who
owned a large ranch&mdash;not of alfalfa, or wheat, or other
grain&mdash;but of rice. One afternoon he stood looking over
his large fields of rice, saying, &#8220;What a rich man this
great harvest makes me!&#8221; Suddenly he felt an earthquake
and saw that the waves of the sea were running
away from the land and rolling far out. He knew that it
would only be a little while before the waves would return
in a great flood, which would overflow the little strip of
land along the seashore, in the valley below the high
plain on which his ranch was situated, and all the people
in the little village would be drowned. It was a holiday
and the people in their merrymaking and fun and laughter
had not noticed the earthquake. The rich man cried to
his servants, &#8220;Bring torches! make haste! set fire to the
rice!&#8221; Then he and his servants set on fire stack after
stack of the rice. In a moment the flames and smoke rose
high, the big bell from the village pealed the fire-signal,
and all the boys and girls and men and women ran up the
hill as fast as they could to see the fire, and to try to save
the rice-crop of the rich man. When they saw him
setting fire to his rice, they shouted, &#8220;Look, he is mad;
he is setting fire to his rice.&#8221; &#8220;Look!&#8221; shouted the old
man. They looked and saw the raging and surging waves
of the sea come rolling in. They looked again a few
moments later and saw nothing but the straw which had
been the thatched roofs of their homes tossing on the
waters and their whole village blotted out by the sea.

&#8220;If I had not done that you would have all been drowned
in those waves!&#8221; He stood among them almost as poor
as any of them, but he had the consciousness that by the
sacrifice of his fortune he had saved four hundred lives
that day.&mdash;<i>Adapted from &#8220;Gleanings in Buddha-fields,&#8221;

<h4>4. THE RUSSIAN SERVANT</h4>

<p>One cold winter day long ago a Russian nobleman and
his wife were traveling across the plains of Russia in a
sleigh drawn by six horses, and their two servants on
horseback were riding beside them. Suddenly they heard
the howling of a great pack of wolves that had been
driven by cold and hunger from the mountains. The
nobleman at once ordered one of the servants to ride on
faster to the town and bring them other horses while
he drove those he had more swiftly. The wolves came
nearer and nearer. The other servant begged his master
to allow him to loose his horse for the wolves to devour,
hoping in this way to save time. But as soon as the
servant sprang into the sleigh the frightened horse was
torn into a thousand pieces by the fierce wolves, and
they were back again more bloodthirsty than before.
While the servant fought them off from the back of the
sleigh the nobleman cut loose one after another of the
horses, until he had but two left. Then the servant said,
&#8220;I will spring among them and that will give you time
to escape!&#8221; &#8220;No! no!&#8221; cried the nobleman. &#8220;See the
lights of the city in the distance. We are almost safe!&#8221;
But the wolves were again upon them and there seemed
no other way, so the servant sprang from the sleigh,
fought and drove back the wolves as far as he could to
save all the time possible, but at last he was overcome by
their great numbers and was devoured. A few moments
later the Russian nobleman and his wife, with the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
horses and the sleigh, passed in through the gate of the
city in safety, conscious that they had been saved only by
the great self-sacrifice of their faithful servant. For a
long time after travelers on that road saw a cross, which
the nobleman had erected on the spot where his servant
had given up his life, and on the cross were these words:
&#8220;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
down his life for his friends.&#8221;</p>

<h4>5. GRACE DARLING</h4>

<p>Once there was a terrible storm at sea, and a steamship
was dashed upon the rocks and split in two. One-half
of the ship was washed away, and those of the passengers
who were still alive, were clinging to the other half upon
the low rocks, lashed by the angry waves. About a mile
away in a lighthouse a brave girl, named Grace Darling,
the daughter of the lighthouse-keeper, heard, above the
noise of the winds and waves, the screams and cries of
the drowning men, and when daylight dawned she could
see the wreck and the men clinging to the masts. &#8220;Let
us go out in the lifeboat and save them?&#8221; she cried.
But her father, who knew the danger in such a storm,
replied, &#8220;It is of no use. We can never reach them!&#8221;
&#8220;We can never stay here and see them die, father,&#8221; Grace
said; &#8220;let us try to save them.&#8221; So the heavy lighthouse
boat was launched, and with Grace pulling at one oar,
and her father at the other, they reached the wreck and
rescued, one by one, the worn-out men, whom they rowed
safely to the lighthouse. Then Grace became as tender a
nurse as she had been brave as a sailor, for she cared
most kindly for the shipwrecked men until the storm
ceased and they were strong enough to go to their own
homes. The heroism of this young woman became known
everywhere. Thousands sang her praises. Artists visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the lighthouse to take her portrait. Three thousand dollars
were subscribed and presented to her. Distinguished
people sent her letters of gratitude. But through all such
praise Grace Darling remained as modest as she was
brave, saying, &#8220;I did not suppose I had done anything
worthy of so much notice.&#8221; When a few years afterward
she died, over her grave, in a little churchyard by the sea,
not far from the lighthouse, a monument was raised in
her honor, where it stands to-day. It is a marble statue
of a woman lying at rest with a boat&#8217;s oar held fast in her
right hand.</p>


<h4>6. THE SURVEYOR AND THE LITTLE BOY</h4>

<p>One spring day, a young surveyor, eighteen years of
age, was eating his dinner with some companions in a
forest in Virginia. Suddenly the sylvan stillness was
startled by the piercing shrieks of a woman. The young
surveyor sprang to his feet and leaped to the woman&#8217;s
side. &#8220;My boy! My boy! Oh, my darling boy is
drowning and they will not let me rescue him,&#8221; screamed
the frantic mother as she tried to escape from the men
who held her from springing into the rapids. &#8220;No, we
will not let her go,&#8221; cried the men, &#8220;for she would be
instantly killed on the sharp rocks and could not rescue
her boy!&#8221; &#8220;Why does not one of you rescue him then?&#8221;
said the manly fellow of eighteen. &#8220;We are not ready
to die yet,&#8221; the men replied. &#8220;O sir, won&#8217;t you do something?&#8221;
cried the mother to the young surveyor. For
an instant he stood measuring the rocks and the whirling
rapids with his eye, and then, throwing off his coat, he
plunged into the roaring torrent where he had caught
sight of the drowning boy. With stout heart and steady
hand he struggled against the seething waters which each
moment threatened to engulf him or dash him to pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
against the sharp-pointed rocks. Just as they thought
both would go over the falls the young engineer clutched
the little fellow and swam with him to the shore. Then,
amid the praises of those who had witnessed his heroism,
mingled with the gratitude of the overjoyed mother, he
placed the unconscious but saved little boy in her arms.
&#8220;God will reward you, young man,&#8221; said the mother;
&#8220;God will reward you some day for your heroism, and
many will praise you for what you have done this day!&#8221;
And so it was; for this young surveyor who saved the
little boy was George Washington.</p>


<h4>7. ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE PIG</h4>

<p>One day as Abraham Lincoln was riding along a country
road on horseback, in company with some friends,
he saw a pig stuck fast in a deep place filled with mud,
struggling to keep from going in deeper. The poor pig
was squealing in terror, and the comical sight filled the
friends with laughter and delight. After Lincoln had
ridden on a little distance, he turned back his horse, saying,
&#8220;Gentlemen, excuse me a few moments,&#8221; and rode
back as fast as he could to the place where the poor
creature was, got down from his horse, and drew the pig
out of the mud. When he rejoined his companions they
asked, &#8220;Why did you go back?&#8221; He told them what he
had done, adding, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep well to-night, if I
hadn&#8217;t done that thing.&#8221;</p>


<h4>8. GLADSTONE AND THE STREET-SWEEPER</h4>

<p>The minister of a church in London was called one day
to see a street-sweeper in his parish who was ill. Asking
him if any one had been to see him, to the surprise of the
minister, the sweeper replied, &#8220;Yes, Mr. Gladstone came
to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>&#8220;Which Mr. Gladstone?&#8221; asked the minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Gladstone, he told me his name was,&#8221; replied
the poor sick boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how came he to see you?&#8221; said the minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the boy, &#8220;he always had a nice word
for me when he passed my crossing, and when I was not
there he missed me. He asked my mate, who had taken
my place, where I was, and when he heard I was ill he
asked for my address, and he put it down on paper. So
he called to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he do?&#8221; asked the minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;He brought me some nice oranges,&#8221; answered the
boy, &#8220;and then he read to me some Bible and prayed,
and it was so good!&#8221;</p>

<p>To a man like Gladstone, living humbly, simply, and
sincerely, it is as important and as interesting a deed to
do a kindness to a poor street-sweeper, and to comfort his
heart with sympathy and love, as to form a cabinet to
govern the English Empire. In such service the words
of George Herbert have their full realization:</p>

<h4>9. GARIBALDI AND THE LOST LAMB</h4>

<p>One evening, in the year 1861, as General Joseph Garibaldi,
the Italian patriot, fighting to make his beloved
Italy free, united, and happy, was going to his headquarters,
he met a Sardinian shepherd lamenting the loss
of a lamb out of his flock. The great-hearted general
at once returned to camp and announced to his officers
his intention of scouring the mountains in search of the
missing sheep. His soldiers, inspired by his tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
on the field of peace as they had been by his valor on
the field of battle, at once organized a grand expedition.
Lanterns were brought and old officers of many a campaign
started off full of enthusiasm to hunt for the lost
lamb. But no lamb was found, and the soldiers returned
to their beds in the camp. The next morning the servant
of General Garibaldi found him in bed fast asleep.
When he was awakened the general rubbed his eyes.
And so did the servant, when he saw the old warrior
bring the lost lamb from under the covering where it
had been kept warm, and request him to carry it back
in safety to the shepherd.</p>

<p>The man who had endured hardship and persecution,
cold and hunger, nakedness and exile to make his native
land free, had thought it a worthy task to keep up his
search throughout the long night for the lost sheep until
he had found it.</p>


<h4>10. HOVENDEN AND THE LITTLE BOY</h4>

<p>Thomas Hovenden, the artist, who painted &#8220;Breaking
the Home Ties,&#8221; &#8220;Jerusalem, the Golden,&#8221; and &#8220;John
Brown&#8221; which were exhibited at the World&#8217;s Fair in
Chicago, was one day standing in a railway depot just
as an engine was dashing into the station. He saw
just in front of the iron-horse some mother&#8217;s darling little
boy, and instantly, without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, he
dropped his satchel and sprang in front of the engine.
He snatched the little boy in his arms, only to be crushed
and ground beneath the wheels of the conscienceless
monster.</p>

<p>Great as are the exhibitions of his artistic genius in
the paintings he has left us to admire, Thomas Hovenden
never made a more wonderful picture in his life. Such a
picture of unselfishness, heroism, and Christlike abandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to save a child, is a picture to be admired in heaven&mdash;a
picture worthy to hang in the palace of God.</p>


<h4>11. THE BOY AND THE TRAIN</h4>

<p>Kenneth Oliver, a boy of eleven years of age,
who lived in Tampico, Ill., returning home from
school one afternoon, saw a little girl only seven years
old playing on the railroad track. Suddenly he noticed
a heavy freight-train coming on, at full speed, drawn by
two great engines. The little girl did not see or hear the
train, and was playing on, entirely unconscious of her
danger. The boy quickly ran to the track, took hold of
the child, and dragged her to one side of the rails,
but he missed his footing, and the boy and girl rolled
down the embankment together just as the train dashed
past. It was not an instant too soon, for the edge of the
pilot-beam struck the girl, bruising her, and missed killing
the boy by an inch. The boy thought nothing of his
danger. The tumble down the bank into the ditch seemed
like a joke to the two children, although they felt the
effects of their somersaults for some time afterward.
The little girl&#8217;s mother, full of gratitude, told what this
boy hero had done; all the country round soon sang his
praises; and not long after he received a medal and two
thousand dollars from the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission.
It had always been his wish to go to college. This
enabled him to get his wish, for the money was enough to
pay for his education.</p>


<h4>12. THE BOY AND THE MAD DOG</h4>

<p>One day in the town of Weser, in Germany, a boy was
playing with his little sister, four years old. Suddenly
the boy saw rushing down the hill a mad dog followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
by men, trying to stop it. In a moment the boy saw that
the dog was running directly toward his little sister.
Not thinking for a moment of his own danger, or escape,
this brave boy in a flash threw off his coat, wrapped it
around his arm, and boldly faced the fierce dog. Holding
out his arm, shielded by the coat, the boy turned the
dog&#8217;s attention to himself, so that the wild beast jumped
at him and worried him until the men came up and
killed the dog. The men said, &#8220;Why did you not run
away from the dog? You could easily have done it.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the boy, &#8220;but if I had he would have
attacked my sister. I thought I would let the dog tear
my coat instead of her!&#8221;</p>


<h4>13. THE GIRL AND HER RED PETTICOAT</h4>

<p>Jennie Clark, a little girl only eleven years old, who
lived in Ohio, was walking along a railroad track one hot
summer afternoon when she noticed that a wooden bridge
over a deep ravine was on fire, evidently caught from a
spark from an engine. She knew that in a few moments
an excursion train to the World&#8217;s Fair was due
to pass over the bridge. As quick as a flash the little
heroine snatched off her red petticoat, and ran swiftly
up the track toward the approaching train, waving her
red petticoat as a danger-signal. The engineer saw the
warning and stopped the train in time to save the lives of
the passengers. Among the hundreds of passengers who
were saved were a number of Frenchmen who, on their
return to France, told this story of the brave little American
girl who had saved the train. The story reached
the ears of President Carnot, who, after communicating
with President McKinley, bestowed upon her the Cross
of the Legion of Honor. This young girl of Ohio, who
so courageously gave herself in such heroic service, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the youngest person in the world to wear the Cross of
the Legion of Honor, France&#8217;s highest award for heroic
service in time of war and peace!</p>


<h4>14. THE NEWSBOY OF GARY</h4>

<p>Billy Rough was a crippled newsboy who owned a
news-stand on a busy street corner in Gary, Ind. But,
though a cripple, Billy was such a cheerful soul that he
did far more than sell newspapers. He gave away sunshine.
He knew his customers and was interested in all
their affairs. As he handed them their papers he asked,
with neighborly cheerfulness, about their welfare. If
the crippled boy had troubles himself, no one ever knew
of them. He was far more anxious to help others bear
their burdens than to add to them by any tales of his
own woes. One day he read in the newspaper of a young
girl who had been terribly burned as the result of a motorcycle
accident. The doctors said her life could only be
saved by grafting some one else&#8217;s skin upon the burned
flesh. Billy Rough said to himself: &#8220;I&#8217;m only a poor
cripple. My life is not of much account. I will offer
my skin.&#8221; He was told that amputation would be necessary
and very dangerous. He said: &#8220;If it will save the
girl, take it off. I&#8217;ll save money. I&#8217;ll only have to buy
one shoe. The leg is of no use to me. Maybe it&#8217;ll help
her. I&#8217;d like to be of some use to some one.&#8221; He saved
her life, but lost his own, for soon after the grafting, he
died, saying: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I done it. Yes, I&#8217;m going, but
I was some good in the world after all.&#8221; The Mayor of
Gary, impressed with this heroic self-sacrifice, issued a
proclamation announcing that contributions for a memorial
would be received. Nine hundred dollars, which
had been sent in for his use before he died, were turned
over to the memorial committee. A statue in Jefferson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Park, a bronze tablet in the building where his news-stand
stood, and an endowed room in the Gary Hospital
where he lay before his death, all testify that the name
of Billy Rough, the crippled newsboy and hero of Gary,
will have an enduring place in the annals of American
heroes.</p>

<h4>1. LONGFELLOW, POET</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> poet, Longfellow, once wrote in his diary, &#8220;We
have but one life to live on earth; we must make that
beautiful.&#8221; The story of this beautiful life began at his
birth in Portland, Me., February 27, 1807. He was
the second of eight children. His father was an honored
lawyer and his mother was a woman of refinement, a
descendant of John Alden of the Mayflower. Henry
was a noble, tender-hearted boy. One day when he
went shooting, he killed a robin. The piteous look of
the little fearless thing so pained him that he never went
shooting again. The first book he loved was Irving&#8217;s
&#8220;Sketch-Book.&#8221; Its strange stories of &#8220;Sleepy Hollow&#8221;
and &#8220;Rip Van Winkle,&#8221; pleased his fancy. During
each summer he used to visit his Grandfather Wadsworth&#8217;s
estate of seven thousand acres, just outside Portland,
where they told him tales of &#8217;76. The story of
the fight with the Indians impressed him so deeply that
at the age of thirteen he wrote his first poem, &#8220;The
Battle of Lovell&#8217;s Pond,&#8221; which he slipped into an envelope
and mailed to a newspaper, telling no one but his
sister. He walked up and down in front of the printing-office,
shivering in the cold, and wondering if his poem
was being put in print. Next morning there was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
poem, signed &#8220;Henry.&#8221; He read it again and again,
and thought it a fine poem. In the evening he and his
father were visiting at a neighbor&#8217;s house, when the
neighbor said to Mr. Longfellow, &#8220;Did you see the little
poem in to-day&#8217;s paper?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said Mr. Longfellow,
&#8220;is it good for anything?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said the neighbor,
&#8220;it&#8217;s stiff, and it&#8217;s all borrowed, every word; why, your
boy there could write much better than that!&#8221; Poor
Henry&#8217;s heart sank. He hurried home and sobbed himself
to sleep that night. Yet criticism did not discourage
this brave boy. He kept trying, saying, &#8220;I will succeed,&#8221;
and he became the best-loved poet of the world. At
fourteen he graduated from Portland Academy, and at
eighteen from Bowdoin College. After three years&#8217; travel
in Europe, he became professor of modern languages in
his alma mater for five years, and then for eighteen years
professor of literature in Harvard, being succeeded by
James Russell Lowell. The school children of Cambridge
celebrated his seventy-second birthday by presenting
him with a chair carved from the wood of the
chestnut tree under which stood the village smithy that
he made famous in his poem, &#8220;The Village Blacksmith.&#8221;
The poet greatly appreciated this gift, and wrote one of
his best poems about it. Each boy and girl who came
was allowed to sit in the chair and each received a copy
of a poem that Longfellow wrote. The same year fifteen
hundred children of Cincinnati celebrated his birthday
with recitations from his poems and singing his songs.
His marble statue stands in the &#8220;Poet&#8217;s Corner,&#8221; in
Westminster Abbey in London, England. His grave is in
Mount Auburn Cemetery, in Cambridge. On his tombstone
is the simple inscription: &#8220;Longfellow.&#8221; That is
enough. There are few schoolboys in America or England
who do not know the story of his beautiful life, or
who have not recited his words in &#8220;A Psalm of Life&#8221;:</p>

<h4>2. MOZART, MUSICIAN</h4>

<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the greatest musicians
and composers that ever lived, was born in Salzburg,
Germany, January 27, 1756. His father was a
famous violinist. At the age of three little Wolfgang
loved to hear the playing of his sister Maria, who was
just five years older. At four he was able to play minuets
and compose little pieces. At five he played in public, and
at six composed a difficult concerto for a full orchestra.
One day before he was seven, his father was walking in
the country with him when they came to a great church
which contained the largest organ Wolfgang had ever
seen. &#8220;Father, let me play it,&#8221; he said. Well pleased,
his father began to blow the bellows. Wolfgang pushed
aside the high stool, stood upon the pedals, and began
playing. Softly at first the deep tones rose, awakening
the stillness of the old church, and then the strains
swelled louder and louder until all who heard marveled
that a young child could play such wonderful music. No
wonder the father was proud of his two children. No
wonder the palaces of Europe were opened to them and
that they were petted, admired, and loaded with caresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and presents. The little boy&#8217;s charming appearance and
cheerful disposition endeared him to all. So innocent
and natural was his manner that at Vienna he sprang up
into the Empress&#8217;s lap and kissed her heartily. In another
place when he slipped upon the polished floor, Marie
Antoinette lifted him up, and he said, &#8220;You are very
kind. When I grow up I will marry you.&#8221; He always
loved his father, and was always gentle and obedient,
saying, &#8220;Next after God is my father.&#8221; Though so
modest, he played without fear before kings.</p>

<p>Many musicians were jealous of his genius and said,
&#8220;A trick is being played on the people.&#8221; So one day he
was invited to the house of a famous musician to play
before a number of great performers. The old musician
gave him the most difficult piece he had ever written,
knowing Mozart had never seen it, and to the wonder of
all, he played it so splendidly they were convinced of his
great genius. But as the envy of his enemies did not decrease,
he was obliged to seek Italy to earn his living.
At Rome he went to the Sistine Chapel to hear the celebrated
&#8220;Miserere,&#8221; which, on returning home, he wrote
down note by note&mdash;a feat which created a great sensation,
for the singers were forbidden to transcribe the
music on penalty of dismissal. So delighted was the pope
with him that he presented Mozart with the Order of the
Golden Spur. He played the harp, the organ, the violin,
and every instrument in the orchestra. He composed
many operas as well as church music and concert music.
Perhaps the happiest part of his life was when he
traveled with his sister and his beloved father, revealing
the wonders of his musical genius to the great of the
earth, not for money or fame, but for the great pleasure
he gave and received from his art.</p>

<p>One day a stranger called on him, requesting him to
compose a requiem, and offering to pay him for this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
advance. Mozart worked hard at it, but when the stranger
returned it was not ready, and he paid the musician some
more money in advance for it. When the stranger called
the third time, Mozart was dead; and the requiem still
unfinished. When he died he was very poor, and the few
friends he had, because it rained on the day of his funeral,
left him unattended, to be carried to his grave in a
potter&#8217;s field. Thus he, who had in his lifetime produced
so much wonderful music, was buried unhonored
and unsung, without funeral ceremony or acclaim. But
to-day, not only in Germany but over all the earth, the
music of his immortal name is heard, and his praise is
sung.</p>


<h4>3. OLE BULL, VIOLINIST</h4>

<p>In the quaint little town of Bergen, in Norway, February
5, 1810, was born a boy, the eldest of ten children.
His father was a chemist, and his mother a noble, intelligent
woman, and they both loved music. Little Ole
Bull would often crawl under the settee or sofa to listen
to the music when his relatives came to his home to sing
and practise, and he was often whipped, when discovered,
for being so naughty. He loved music, and when he was
in the field, where he often played alone, he thought he
heard the music of the little bluebells swinging in the
wind, as he lay among the flowers. When he was four
years old his uncle gave him a yellow violin. He kissed
it in his delight, and began to learn the notes at the
same time that he did his letters, and although forbidden
to play until after study hours, he often forgot and was
punished both at home and in school. When he was
eight years old a music-teacher was provided, and his
father bought him a new, red violin. That night Ole
could not sleep. In his night-dress he stole to the room
where the violin lay, and because it was so red and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
pretty, and the pearl screws smiled at him, he just
pinched the strings, and when it smiled more and more,
he had to try the bow, and then he forgot that it was
night and everybody asleep, so he played, very softly at
first, and then he kept on forgetting until suddenly&mdash;crack
went his father&#8217;s whip across Ole&#8217;s back, and the
little red violin fell to the floor and was broken. He
said, &#8220;I wept much for it, but it did no good, for the
doctor never could make it well.&#8221; But he kept on with
his study, and in two years he began to compose his own
music, making his violin sing with the birds and brook,
the roar of the waterfall, the dripping of the rain, and
the whispering of the wind. When Ole was eighteen he
went to the University at Christiania, where he attracted
the attention of one of the professors, who encouraged
him to give concerts and later aided him with money to
go to Paris. In that great city no one cared for this
unknown violinist, and he could not get a chance to play.
One day when he had but little money left, an old man
who lived in the same house with him advised the violinist
to draw all his money out of the bank, pretending
that it was not safe there. Ole drew his money out, and
that night the old man stole all Ole&#8217;s money and clothes,
leaving him penniless in the strange city. In his distress
he sought a new home in a house with a card in the window,
&#8220;Furnished Rooms to Let.&#8221; He went up the steps
and when the woman saw how ill and poor he looked,
she said there was no room. But her little granddaughter
said, &#8220;Look at him, grandmamma.&#8221; The old lady put on
her glasses and saw he looked like her son who had died,
and so she took Ole in and nursed him tenderly through
brain fever. Later little Felice, the granddaughter, became
Ole&#8217;s wife. A nobleman asked him to play at a grand
concert, where he earned three hundred dollars. Then
he took lessons of some great teachers and made a tour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of the world on which he received great sums for his
playing. In America his audiences went wild with delight.
He used to visit the asylums and hospitals and
play for the inmates. All through his life he tried to help
others, not only with his music, but with his money. His
sweet wife and his beautiful children died, and he was
left alone, but he was never too sorrowful or too busy
to help the most humble who came to him. He died at
his beautiful home near Bergen, Norway. At his funeral
the rich and great gathered to honor him, and after his
body was lowered into its flower-hung grave, the poor
peasants came by hundreds with their green boughs or
sprigs of fern or wildflowers and filled his grave with
them&mdash;because they loved him!</p>


<h4>4. LOUISA MAY ALCOTT, AUTHOR</h4>

<p>Louisa May Alcott was born in Germantown, Pa.,
November 29, 1832. Her father was a cultured school-teacher
and her mother of an old aristocratic family.
Louisa was the eldest of four daughters, whose happy
life she pictures in &#8220;Little Women,&#8221; herself being &#8220;Jo.&#8221;
She was a wild, happy-hearted, enthusiastic girl, preferring
whistling and romping and boys&#8217; games rather than
girls&#8217;. Their home was frequently visited by such literary
people as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, who
were her father&#8217;s friends. At eight years of age she
wrote this poem of eight lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Welcome, welcome, little stranger,</div>
<div class="verse">Fear no harm and fear no danger;</div>
<div class="verse">We are glad to see you here,</div>
<div class="verse">For you sing, &#8220;Sweet spring is near.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Now the white snow melts away;</div>
<div class="verse">Now the flowers blossom gay.</div>
<div class="verse">Come, dear bird, and build your nest</div>
<div class="verse">For we love our robin best.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>Her mother preserved this poem, and told her if she
kept on she might one day be a second Shakespeare.
She was fond of telling fairy stories to amuse her sisters
and friends, and often turned the old tales into little
plays which the children acted in a barn. One of these
plays was &#8220;Jack and the Bean Stalk.&#8221; A squash vine,
placed in the barn, was the bean-stalk, and when it was
cut down the boy who played Giant, would come tumbling
down from the hay-loft. At thirteen she wrote the
beautiful poem, &#8220;My Kingdom.&#8221; After she became a
school-teacher she was always helping somebody, taking
care of an invalid or the poor, or sewing to help her
mother. She continued to write stories. Some of the
stories were rejected and the publisher advised her to
stick to her school-teaching. Returning from the Civil
War, where she had been a valued nurse to the wounded
soldiers, she presented, through her father, several short
stories to a publisher, who rejected them, with the advice
that she write a story for girls. She thought she could
not do that, and wrote &#8220;Little Women&#8221; to prove that
she could not, but it is perhaps the best-loved girls&#8217; story
ever written. Then she wrote &#8220;Little Men,&#8221; of which
fifty thousand copies were ordered before it was printed.
She received one hundred thousand dollars for her books.
Her life-desire was now realized in having money enough
to make her family comfortable. Her father died in 1888,
and she followed him only three days after. Miss Louisa
May Alcott, besides being a writer, was also an earnest
advocate of woman suffrage and temperance.</p>


<h4>5. ROSA BONHEUR, PAINTER</h4>

<p>Rosa was born in poverty. Her father, an artist too,
was compelled to give drawing lessons, and her mother
had to go from house to house teaching music to assist in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
supporting their four children. Her mother dying when
Rosa was twelve years old, and her father marrying
again, the gifted girl was sent away to school where she
spent most of her time in drawing funny pictures of her
teachers. Later her father taught her to copy the old
masters in the Louvre. When she was seventeen she determined
her life-work&mdash;animal painting; but being too
poor to buy models, she would take long walks into the
country to study and draw living animals, and later on
kept a sheep on her roof-garden for a model. At nineteen
she sent two pictures to the Fine Arts Exposition, &#8220;Goat
and Sheep&#8221; and &#8220;Two Rabbits,&#8221; and others soon followed.
When her father died she took his place as
Director of the School of Design for Girls, and her sister,
Juliette, became a teacher in the same school. She
studied eighteen months before painting &#8220;The Horse
Fair,&#8221; which famous picture was purchased in England
for eight thousand dollars, and later by A. T. Stewart,
of New York, and is now in his collection in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. Landseer, the great English
artist, said of her &#8220;Horse Fair,&#8221; &#8220;It surpasses me, although
it&#8217;s a little hard to be beaten by a woman.&#8221;
When at her work Rosa Bonheur often dressed in male
attire with a large, white collar. She was always busy,
cheerful, and generous. Her pictures brought her large
sums, which she spent not only in providing for her
family and old servants, but in generously assisting poor
students. She had one of the most beautiful studios in
Paris. When Prussia conquered France the Prussian
soldiers were ordered not to disturb Rosa Bonheur or
her servants. The poor idolized this wonderful woman,
for she always loved them. She died at her home May
25, 1899. But through her wonderful works she still
helps us to see the beauty of common things and to feel
the poetry in what might seem the drudgery of life.</p>

<h4>6. JENNY LIND, SINGER</h4>

<p>Jenny Lind, the &#8220;Swedish nightingale,&#8221; fills a place all
her own among the world&#8217;s great artists of song. Gifted
in voice, beautiful in face, lovely in character, a princess
among givers, the guardian angel of the poor and unfortunate,
she was for many years the idol of all classes
of people, adored not simply for her talent, but also as
one of the most perfect of women. She was born in
Stockholm, Sweden, October 6, 1820. Her father was a
good-natured man, who enjoyed song, but he was unable
to provide for his family. Her mother was a woman
of determination, who helped care for the family by teaching
school. When very small Jenny showed a love for
the singing of birds, and often when she sang to her
pet cat, as it sat with a blue ribbon around its neck in the
window, people in the street used to listen and wonder.
One day a lady heard the child&#8217;s voice, and said, &#8220;She
is a genius; she must be trained.&#8221; At nine she sang before
the music-master of the Royal Theater, and he was
moved to tears and at once accepted her, and for ten
years she was educated in singing and elocution at the
expense of the government of Sweden. Jenny began to
act and sing in the Royal Theater at ten, and sang and
played continuously until she was twenty. From twelve
to fifteen she sang in concerts, and the Swedish people
became very proud of her. At twenty she was made a
member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and
was appointed court singer. The progress in her art
led her to devote four hours or more daily for almost
a year in practising the scales and exercises under a great
teacher in Paris. Then she began to travel through
Europe, singing before kings, nobles, and distinguished
people, and to crowded audiences who hailed her as &#8220;the
first singer of the world,&#8221; and paid enormous prices to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
hear her. At last she consented to sing in the United
States. When she arrived at New York thousands were
on the dock eager to catch a glimpse of her. Triumphal
arches surmounted by eagles bore the inscription, &#8220;Welcome,
Jenny Lind. Welcome to America!&#8221; At the first
concert, where thousands listened enchanted to her in
Castle Garden in New York, some persons paid as high
as six hundred and fifty dollars for a single ticket.
Jenny Lind&#8217;s share for this one concert was nearly ten
thousand dollars. She immediately sent for the mayor of
the city and distributed the whole amount among charitable
institutions. Throughout her life she felt that the
money she earned was only hers in trust, as well as her
voice. She said: &#8220;It is a great joy and a gift from God
to be allowed to earn so much money and afterward to
help one&#8217;s fellow men with it. This is the highest joy I
wish for in life.&#8221; Everywhere she gave benefit concerts
for charitable institutions or for individuals in need. In
New York alone she gave away forty thousand dollars in
charities. When warned against so much liberality, as
some unworthy persons would seek aid, she always replied,
&#8220;Never mind, if I assist ten and one is worthy,
I am satisfied.&#8221; At thirty-one she married Mr. Otto
Goldschmidt, of Hamburg, an accomplished musician,
and they secured a beautiful residence in England, where
they lived most happily for many years, until her death,
November 2, 1887, at the age of sixty-seven. Queen
Victoria, who had often heard her sing and who greatly
honored her, sent a wreath of beautiful white flowers.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn said of her, &#8220;I never met so noble, so
true, and real an art nature as Jenny Lind.&#8221; N. P. Willis
said: &#8220;To give away more money in charity than any
other mortal; to be humble, simple, genial, unassuming,
and still be the first of prima donnas; to have begun as
a beggar girl and risen to receive more honor than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
queen, this is the combination that makes the wonder
of a dozen heroines in one single girl.&#8221;</p>


<h4>7. LINCOLN, EMANCIPATION PRESIDENT</h4>

<p>When the Hall of Fame was opened in New York
City, George Washington was found to have the votes of
one hundred per cent of the electors, and Abraham
Lincoln came next with ninety-nine per cent. Lincoln,
the great emancipator of four million slaves, and the
preserver of the nation&#8217;s unity, came next to Washington,
the Father and first President of his country. In Harden,
now Larue County, Ky., February 12, 1809, he
was born and grew up in such poverty as few boys have
ever known. His mother died when the little fellow was
very young, so that not until little Abe was seven years
old, and his stepmother, a woman of energy and intelligence,
took charge of the desolate household, did the
shaggy-headed, ragged, barefoot, forlorn lad begin &#8220;to
feel like a human being.&#8221; From the time he could hold
an axe in his little hand he was expected to work. His
father was a lazy, shiftless, &#8220;poor Southern white,&#8221;
which is the last word in unthrift. He hired out Abe to
the neighbors to plow, dig ditches, chop wood, drive
oxen, and &#8220;tend the baby&#8221; when a farmer&#8217;s wife was
busy, keeping all the scanty wages Abe earned and growling
because the lad loved to read when he had finished his
work. Often he came home at night all aching with cold
and wet, not to lounge at leisure as other boys, but while
his parents slept, he rolled another log on the fire to give
him light, or by the aid of a pine-knot stuck in the wall
to light the dingy cabin, he read such books as he could
borrow. When sixteen years old, besides being a rail-splitter
and teamster, he was earning six dollars a month
by managing a ferryboat across the Ohio River. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the turning-point in his life came when he found
two old law-books that had been thrown away with
some rubbish he was hauling. He read these books and
stored up the information they gave. His wide reading
enabled him later to speak eloquently, especially against
the slave-trade which he hated. One day, passing
through the great slave-market of New Orleans, and
seeing a girl being auctioned from the slave-block, his
soul was so kindled that he decided then and there, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
knock that thing hard, if I ever get a chance.&#8221; And he
did. He was tender-hearted, and nothing aroused him
more than to see a helpless animal or person mistreated.</p>

<p>He was six feet four inches tall, awkward and homely
in countenance, very powerful, a famous wrestler, but he
was never known to use his strength for his own benefit,
and while he whipped the bullies that made him fight, he
never picked a quarrel in his life. He served as captain
in the Black Hawk war, and at the age of twenty-two
ran for the legislature and was defeated. He ran a country
store in Springfield, Ill., and failed, but he paid up
the last dollar, although this took him fourteen years to
do. He studied law and became a leading lawyer, admired
for his honesty as well as industry. He stood
always for peace if possible, and often persuaded his
clients to make up their quarrel in his office instead of
going to law. While he was an attorney, feeling that his
lack of education put him at a disadvantage with Eastern
men who, educated and trained in great colleges, were
coming West, he determined &#8220;to be ready for them,&#8221;
and so undertook a home course of study in mathematics,
logic, and literature. It was hard work, but he won. He
was elected to the Legislature of Illinois, sent to Congress
at Washington, became the leader of the Republican
party, and in 1860 was elected President of the nation.
During the terrible years of the Civil War his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
guided the torn and distracted country out of the cyclone
of hatred and bloodshed into peace and prosperity. Few
souls in history have had fiercer trials than those through
which he passed. His friends grew impatient and found
fault, his enemies jeered, his closest followers doubted,
but he could neither be hurried, delayed, nor swerved
from the cause of right he had laid out for himself. His
patience, self-possession, resources, tact, large-heartedness,
and faith in God never failed him.</p>

<p>On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln signed the
Proclamation of Emancipation, and by his stroke of the
pen set four million human beings free. No wonder that
in many churches in the United States, as well as in England,
Christian people sang &#8220;The year of jubilee is
come!&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of his lack of early education, his speeches and
documents are among the finest in our history. His
Gettysburg address every boy should know. In his second
inaugural address this sentence occurs: &#8220;With malice
toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
right as God gives us to see the right, let us finish the
work we are in, to bind up the nation&#8217;s wounds, to care
for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his
widow and his orphans, to do all which may achieve and
cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and
with all nations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as he was about to enjoy the hard-won victory
of peace, an insane assassin laid low the great emancipator,
&#8220;a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom.&#8221; He died
April 15, 1865, sincerely mourned by &#8220;the boys in blue&#8221;
and &#8220;the boys in gray&#8221; and the States of the nation
that he had saved in union.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln will always rank as one of the greatest
presidents, and, as the years roll on, his place in the
affection and reverence of his countrymen becomes more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
secure. James Russell Lowell wrote this fitting tribute
to him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Our children shall behold his fame,</div>
<div class="indent">The kindly, earnest, brave, far-seeing man,</div>
<div class="verse">Sagacious, patient, dreading praise, not blame,</div>
<div class="indent">New birth of our new soil, the first American.</div>
</div></div>


<h4>8. HORACE GREELEY, EDITOR</h4>

<p>Horace Greeley was born February 11, 1811, on a
small stony farm in New Hampshire, in a lonely, unpainted
house. His parents were very poor, being unable
to feed and clothe and educate their family of seven children,
of whom Horace was the third. His mother, a
bright, cheerful, laughing woman, loved to tell her children
stories. When Horace was two years old he would
lie on the floor and look at the words in the Bible and
ask about the letters. At three he went to school, and very
soon learned to read and to spell wonderfully. Before
he was six he had read the Bible, &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress,&#8221;
and every book he could borrow. He would lie before
the fireplace after a hard day&#8217;s work on the farm and
read by the light of a pine-knot. When he went to bed,
he would tell his brother what he had been reading or
studying, but his brother would fall asleep while Horace
was talking.</p>

<p>When he was thirteen the school-teacher said to
Horace&#8217;s father, &#8220;Mr. Greeley, your boy knows more
than I do. It is no use to send him to school any more.&#8221;
He had always wanted to be a printer. One day he
walked twelve miles and was given a trial in a printer&#8217;s
office. He learned more in a day than most boys do in a
month. The other boys joked him. They threw ink and
type at him. Because Horace&#8217;s hair was light, they got
the ink-ball and stained it black. Everybody looked for
a fight, but he good-naturedly washed the ink from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
hair, and became the favorite of all. During the four years
he spent learning his trade he visited his home twice,
walking most of the six hundred miles each way. Later he
trudged all the way on foot to New York, walking along
the canal-path, and arrived there with all his clothes
in a bundle carried over his back with a stick, and with
but ten dollars in his pocket. Soon he started the printing
of several cheap newspapers, but he lost money on
each of these until, on borrowed money, he started the
New York Tribune, which has been increasingly successful
to the present time. His income from the Tribune
was long above fifteen thousand dollars a year, frequently
as much as thirty-five thousand dollars or more. Subscriptions
for his paper were found in all the North
from Maine to Oregon, large packages going to remote
rural districts, and everywhere a personal affection for
the editor was felt. In his editorials he advocated from
time to time such doctrines as protective tariff, national
cooperation for the elevation of labor, total abstinence
from intoxicating liquors, and above all, antislavery. He
was elected to Congress, and while there introduced the
first bill for giving small tracts of government land free
to actual settlers. He wrote books, visited Europe, and
traveled through America to California. On his return
he wrote, &#8220;Go West, young man!&#8221; He helped to nominate
Lincoln for president, and later was himself nominated
for president, being defeated by Grant by more
than one-half million majority. One month after this
great defeat his wife died, and soon after he was attacked
with brain fever and died November 29, 1872, aged sixty-one
years. Through life his personal peculiarities, careless
dress, and independent manners, had brought upon
him endless ridicule, but his death revealed his high
position as a leader of opinion and, as Whittier called
him, &#8220;our later Franklin.&#8221;</p>

<h4>9. AUDUBON, NATURALIST</h4>

<p>Every boy who loves out-of-door life should know the
story of John James Audubon. He was born on a farm
in Louisiana, May 4, 1780. His parents were French
and when very young he was taken to France where he
attended school. His favorite study was of animals and
birds. He often roamed the woods, bringing home birds&#8217;
nests and eggs, curious rocks, and bits of moss. His
father bought him a picture-book of birds. The delighted
boy painted these copies, but saw they were not like real
birds. Later he took lessons of the great French painter,
David, who taught him to draw and paint things as they
are. Returning to America, his father gave him a large
farm in Pennsylvania where his studies of birds led him
to decide to write a book on bird life, and illustrate it by
his own drawings. This was a great task, but when this
young man decided to do anything he never allowed
difficulties to stand in his way. So he began his work and
studied and painted year after year. He had to live
much of the time in the woods, studying how the birds
lived and built their nests. Sometimes he went by boat
down the river; sometimes he went on horseback. Often
he tramped alone through the trackless woods. Many
nights he slept out-of-doors. He lost all his money and
was obliged to stop his work and paint portraits and sell
his choice drawings for a living. His heroic wife took
up school-teaching to help him out with his work. One
day while traveling he left his paintings of nearly a
thousand birds in a wooden box in the home of a friend.
Two months later, when he returned and opened the box,
he found two large rats had got into the box and cut
up all the paintings with their sharp teeth, making a nest
for their young among the gnawed pieces. He said,
&#8220;I will make better paintings!&#8221; It took him four long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
years to complete his pictures, but at last the great book
was completed and published and praised throughout
France, England, and the United States.</p>

<p>The Society for the Protection of Our Feathered
Friends was organized by this great naturalist, who spent
the rest of his life for this great object. At present there
are few places where boys and girls have not heard of
Audubon. He died at his beautiful home on the Hudson
River, greatly honored and beloved in France, England,
and the United States.</p>


<h4>10. EDISON, WIZARD OF ELECTRICITY</h4>

<p>Thomas Alva Edison, the &#8220;Wizard of Electricity,&#8221;
was born in Milan, Ohio, February 11, 1847. His birthplace
was located on the canal. As there were no railways,
it was a very busy little place. Edison used to
spend all his playtime at the shops where the canal-boats
were built, learning all about the tools being used. Thus
before he was seven he began to show his love of machinery.
When he was seven years old his parents removed
to Michigan. Edison was already well advanced
in education for a boy of his age, for his mother had
been his careful teacher and companion. They had read
and discussed many books together, especially history,
of which he was very fond. Two or three books on electricity
had come into his hands and these he read with
great interest. As his father was poor, it became necessary,
when Thomas was eleven years of age, for him to
earn his own living. He applied for a position as newsboy
on the Grand Trunk Railroad, and he was soon making
from four to five dollars a day. When the Civil
War broke out his earnings so greatly increased that he
hired another boy, and had a place fixed up in an express
car, in which he placed a small printing-press and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
to publish a paper of his own. He gathered his news
on the train and from agents on the route, often securing
the latest news being telegraphed to the great papers.
His papers had a good sale. Stevenson, the great English
engineer, was so pleased with a copy he bought on
the train, and with its editor, that he took one thousand
copies, and thus the <i>Weekly</i> and its editor became known
and quoted in England. He was reading, studying, and
experimenting every moment he could get from his work.
But he experimented once too often when a bottle of
phosphorus was jerked out of his hand by the jolting of
the train and instantly the car was in flames. The conductor
helped put out the fire and then deposited the
youthful inventor, with his printing-press, on the platform
of the next station. This ended his laboratory on
the train, but he still continued his work, and coaxed his
father to let him fit up a workshop at home, where he
experimented with telegraph instruments, stringing wires
on trees, insulating them with old bottles, and teaching
his boy friends the mystery of their use. He was anxious
to learn telegraphy, which he succeeded in doing, being
taught by a telegraph-operator whose little child Thomas
had saved from being killed by a freight-train at
the risk of his own life. He soon secured a night
operator&#8217;s position, but instead of sleeping in the daytime,
young Edison spent his days experimenting, and
so was too sleepy at night to do his work well. He lost
several night positions, but soon got day-work and continued
his experiments. He went from city to city, but
he cared more for the wonders of electricity than the
routine of office work, though his work was always accurate.
In Boston he chanced to buy Faraday&#8217;s book on
electricity, and at once decided that life was short, and
he had so much to do that he must hustle&mdash;and he has
been hustling ever since.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>His first invention was an automatic repeater by which
messages could be transmitted without the presence of
the operator. Since then his inventions have been many
and important, among them the quadruplex telegraph,
the printing telegraph, the megaphone, the aerophone,
the phonograph, the moving-picture machine, the storage
battery, the incandescent lamp and light system, and the
kinetoscope. He has received patents for more than
seven hundred inventions by which daily life has been
made more attractive. Thomas Alva Edison is the foremost
genius of his day, and the modern magician who
has made &#8220;the fairy tales of science&#8221; as fascinating as
&#8220;Aladdin&#8217;s Wonderful Lamp,&#8221; or &#8220;Boots and His
Brothers.&#8221;</p>


<h4>11. BURBANK, FAIRY GODFATHER OF THE ORCHARDS</h4>

<p>This is the story of a boy with a magic wand who
has made everything he touched more beautiful and more
useful. Even when a little baby, he would hold flowers
in his hands for hours, never harming them. He loved
flowers best of all&mdash;better than pets or animals or playthings;
better than anything else in the world except his
dear mother with her loving, smiling eyes. He and his
mother were chums. His father loved books, but his
mother loved flowers. While Luther Burbank loved
beautiful thoughts from books, like his father, the flowers,
trees, and plants that his mother loved, attracted
him to the fields and orchards. All the time he
longed to help nature. He wondered if he could make
weeds useful and make more and better potatoes grow
in each hill. He planted the potato-seed ball, watched it,
picked it up when the dog knocked it down and, after a
great deal of work he had the delicious Burbank potato.</p>

<p>Then, taking the little field-daisy that he found growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
by the roadside, he sent to Japan for daisies from
that land, and planted the two together. The bees carried
the pollen from one flower to another, and after a long
time there was the beautiful Shasta Daisy, which is
named for Mount Shasta that is within sight of Mr.
Burbank&#8217;s home.</p>

<p>He is the fairy godfather of the orchards, for he
waves his magic wand, and year after year his trees bear
finer fruit&mdash;sweeter oranges, better plums, larger apricots;
and the world is richer for his work.</p>

<p>He teaches the men who help him his magic. They
grow tender-eyed, and their fingers are quick and gentle
as they plant the tiny seeds, set the tender grafts, and
nurse the little frail flower-stalks. He is now a rich man,
but he was not always so. When he first left his home in
Massachusetts to go to California, he could get no work,
and he was often hungry. At last he got a place in a
hothouse doing the work he loved&mdash;tending flowers and
plants. But the poor boy had no money for a room, and
had to sleep in the plant-house. But this place was so
damp he grew ill, and a poor woman, seeing that he was
ill because he did not have the right kind of food, made
him drink a pint of milk from her one cow every day.
Luther was afraid he might never be able to pay her back,
but when he got better and was able to work he paid the
good woman for the milk.</p>

<p>When people saw what a wonderful boy Luther Burbank
really was, he had more than he could do. He
saved his money, bought a little farm, and began to invent
wonderful ways of doing things. Later he bought a
great nursery, where he loved to experiment with plants
and berries and vegetables. He took the prickly, ugly
cactus growing in the desert, scratching the hands and
tearing the clothes, and caused it to shed its thorns and
to put forth flowers and fruit that is good for man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
beast. No wonder he is called the &#8220;Fairy Godfather of
the Orchards,&#8221; this man with the smiling blue eyes, loving
boys and girls next after the flowers, and loving his
mother best of all. What is the magic wand of the
&#8220;Flower Magician&#8221;? It is &#8220;Patient Toil&#8221;!</p>


<h4>12. MARY LYON, EDUCATOR</h4>

<p>Girls who appreciate the possibility of the higher education
of women in America will hold the name of Mary
Lyon in high esteem. She was born on a stony Massachusetts
farm, February 28, 1797. She was not pretty,
but her face was bright and intelligent, and her spirit
was proud, energetic, and helpful. She loved to devise
ways by which she could do the largest amount of work
in the shortest time. One day she said, &#8220;Mother, I have
found a way to make time.&#8221; At school she showed a
wonderfully retentive memory. When Mary was still
young, her father died, leaving the family quite poor.
But Mary&#8217;s mother with energy, prudence, and cheerfulness,
managed the little farm so as to keep her children
together. Her flowers were the sweetest anywhere. She
always found time to do many kind deeds for her neighbors.
Struggling against poverty, Mary taught school
for almost nothing; spun and wove her own clothes;
and studied hard. Her friends thought her foolish to
try and learn so much, saying she could never use it.
But deep down in her heart she felt she was to lift the
world toward the higher education of woman. So she
toiled on for years amid hardship, disappointment, and
opposition, for neither the men nor the women of that
day approved of women being educated or speaking in
public. When she solicited funds for her college her
friends thought she was unwomanly and a disgrace to her
sex. But her earnest, unselfish, persistent spirit won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
friends for her cause, and on October 3, 1836, Mount
Holyoke Seminary, the first school in America for the
higher education of women, was founded. She was at
the head of it until her death. Her influence over the
young ladies was wonderful. She was firm but kind,
always expecting them to do right without rules. She
was greatly beloved. When she died she was buried in
the seminary grounds and a beautiful marble tablet stands
over her honored grave, on one side of which are the
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mary Lyon, the Founder of Mount Holyoke Female
Seminary, and for twelve years its Principal; a Teacher
for more than thirty-five years and of more than three
thousand pupils. Born Feb. 28, 1797; Died March 5, 1849.</p></blockquote>

<p>After her death a paper was found containing seven
ways of wasting time, against which she guarded, as
follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">2. Anticipating needlessly.</div>
<div class="verse">3. Needless speculations.</div>

<div class="verse">7. Spending time in reveries which should be spent in prayer.</div>
</div></div>


<h4>13. FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE, NURSE</h4>

<p>Florence Nightingale was born in Florence, Italy, in
1820. She was the daughter of an English landowner,
who lived on a picturesque estate in Derbyshire, and who
gave her the best education she could secure from books,
school, and travel. As a little girl she showed great
interest in the poor and sick, and was kind to animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Even the squirrels on the lawn made friends with her.
Often as she sat at her father&#8217;s table with all the good
things to eat and the beautiful silver, glass, and china
before her, she would think of the poor and sick who
were without even an orange to quench the thirst of
fever. Frequently she drove with her father&#8217;s physician
into the country, taking baskets filled with dainties, often
denying herself something that she might share with
others. Everybody loved to have her enter the sickroom,
for her unselfish and helpful nature made her a
tender nurse. Until then, nurses were taken from the
same class of women as ordinary domestic servants. Few
realized that nursing was an art to be learned, requiring
intelligence, knowledge, and skill, as well as sympathy and
love. But the devotion of Florence Nightingale changed
all this. She was an accomplished young lady, possessing
abundant wealth. She was happy at home, a general
favorite, and the center of an admiring circle. She was
favored with everything that might have made her social
and domestic life full of attractiveness to most young
women. But she turned her back on the gay world that
opened to her to tread a path that led to suffering and
sorrow. She went to Germany to take training as a
nurse, beginning at the very start. She learned the use
of the washing-cloth, the scrubbing-brush, and the duster.
For three months she was in daily and nightly attendance
on the sick in the German hospital. Returning to England
she gave her time, strength, and means to nursing
her sisters in the Hospital for Sick Governesses in London.
Here her health began to fail, and she returned
home to seek the needed rest in her father&#8217;s home of
wealth. But a new cry arose for help. The Crimean war
was raging. There was a great want of skilled nurses to
relieve the dreadful sufferings of the wounded soldiers
who were lying in the hospitals. She at once offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
her services to her country, and was sent, with thirty-four
other women nurses, reaching Russia on the day of
the fearful battle of Inkerman, November 5, 1854. The
hospitals were filled with sick and wounded soldiers&mdash;four
thousand suffering from cholera and other horrors
that war brings. Miss Nightingale met the wounded
and dying with smiles and words of cheer. Many of the
sick wept for joy at the first touch of a woman&#8217;s hand
they had felt for years. She seemed to be everywhere,
superintending the washing of their clothing, and beds,
cooking their food, assisting the chaplain with his school,
furnishing books for the soldiers to read, writing their
letters, saving their money, or sending it to their relatives
at home. How the soldiers loved her! Many of them
whom she could not personally tend kissed her very
shadow as it fell on their pillows, as she passed at night.
They called her the &#8220;Lady of the Lamp.&#8221;</p>

<div class="verse">No! &#8217;Tis an earthly form with human face!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Returning to England at the close of the war she was
invited to Balmoral Castle by Queen Victoria, who gave
her a beautiful jewel, an emblem of her work, with the
inscription, &#8220;Blessed are the Merciful,&#8221; engraved on one
side, surmounted by a crown of diamonds. The English
Government gave her two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, which she used in founding &#8220;The Nightingale
School of Nurses&#8221; in London. The English soldiers
wanted to erect a statue of her in London, and each
promised to give one penny for it, thinking she could not
object to a gift so small from each grateful giver; but she
refused to let them do it, telling them that it would please
her more if they would give the money to the hospitals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
She left a record of unselfish devotion to duty which
has enriched the world. She died in 1910, full of years
and honors.</p>

<h4>14. FRANCES E. WILLARD, REFORMER</h4>

<p>Frances E. Willard was born in Churchville, near
Rochester, N. Y. When she was two years old her
family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, and when she was five,
to the beautiful farm in Wisconsin, &#8220;Forest Home.&#8221;
Here she spent her girlhood, working and playing in the
fields with her only brother and sister Mary. Her
father promised each of the children a library if they
would not use coffee or tea until they were twenty-one.
They gladly complied with this condition, because each of
them had a great thirst for knowledge. Frances wrote
stories, plays, poems, and essays at an early age, and at
sixteen she won a prize for an essay on &#8220;Country
Houses.&#8221; At eighteen she entered Milwaukee College,
but with the removal of the family to Evanston, Ill., she
entered Northwestern University, graduating with honors.
She first taught a country school, then became teacher
in her alma mater, then a teacher in Pittsburg Female
Seminary, and later preceptress in the Genesee
Wesleyan Seminary, at Lima, N. Y. After a short time
of travel in Europe studying widely and writing for
American magazines, she made so deep an impression in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
an address delivered at a woman&#8217;s missionary meeting,
that she was urged to become a lecturer, which she did
with great success. In 1871 she was elected president of
the woman&#8217;s college of her alma mater, and two years
later she became dean of the college and professor of
esthetics in the Northwestern University. In 1873 she
gave up her college work to organize the Woman&#8217;s
Christian Temperance Union of America, and to begin
her twelve years&#8217; campaign with lectures before four
thousand audiences. She was largely instrumental in
securing the enactment of laws in many States of the
Union to introduce physiological temperance and the scientific
study of stimulants and narcotics into the curriculum
of the public schools. For years she was misunderstood;
often bitterly criticized, despised, and
scorned. But at last she triumphed! Distinguished
philanthropists, reformers, and citizens of England assembled
in the City Temple of London to give her a reception,
and heaped upon her the highest honors, which
she modestly received in the name of the women of
America. Beginning with nothing, in twenty years,
single-handed, this noble woman organized the women
of her country into a vast army that extends to village
and city, and State and nation, and to foreign lands, with
vast equipment of more than sixty departments and
methods of activity for public agitation, a system of
temperance journals for children and youth for securing
instruction in the public schools upon the nature of
stimulants. It is said Frances Willard was a woman
without a fault. Not only in temperance, but in every
good work, did she work for the redemption of humanity.
In an article to girls, she wrote: &#8220;Keep to your specialty,
whether it is raising turnips, or painting screens or battle
scenes, studying political economy or domestic receipts.
Have a resolute aim. If I were asked the mission of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
ideal woman, I would reply, &#8216;It is to make the whole
world homelike!&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<h4>15. LIVINGSTONE, MISSIONARY-EXPLORER</h4>

<p>David Livingstone was born in Blantyre, Scotland,
March 19, 1813. His father was a traveling tea-merchant
who often acted as a colporter, distributing tracts, and
showing a true missionary spirit. His mother was an
active, sunny, loving woman. His home, enriched by
little beyond the bare necessities of life, was happy and
brightened by industry, cheerfulness, love for one
another, and faith in God. He was a good boy to his
mother, often helping her sweep and even scrub, &#8220;if
she would bolt the door so none of the boys would see
him,&#8221; because in Scotland it was thought beneath a man&#8217;s
dignity to &#8220;help the women-folk.&#8221; It was the proud
boast of his mother that in his sweeping, &#8220;he even swept
under the door-mat.&#8221; He loved to climb the hills of
beautiful Scotland, gathering wildflowers, curious stones,
and mineral specimens. One day he climbed the highest
tower in the ruins of Bothwell Castle and carved his
name above those of the other boys. When he was ten
he was sent to work as a piecer in a cotton-factory. With
a part of his first week&#8217;s wages he purchased a Latin
grammar. Although working from six in the morning
until eight at night, he attended night-school from eight
to ten, learning Latin and the sciences. At the age of
sixteen he was familiar with Virgil and Horace and other
classical authors. In his thirst for knowledge he placed
his book on the spinning-jenny where he could read it as
he walked back and forth at his work. When he was
nineteen he gave up his work in the winter months to
attend Glasgow University, where he studied Greek,
medicine, and theology. He became deeply interested in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
missionary work and desired to go to China, but Dr.
Robert Moffat persuaded him to go to Africa by telling
him that &#8220;on a clear morning could be seen the smoke
of a thousand villages where no missionary had ever
been.&#8221; So, in December, 1840, he began the long, five-months&#8217;
trip to the far-off African coast, studying the
stars and taking observations by them, which experience
was of great value to him later when in Africa he was
deserted by his guides and had to blaze his own trail.
He traveled inland, first learning the language and then
preaching, healing, and teaching. In the forest one day
he shot at a lion which sprang upon him, caught him by
the shoulder, shook him as a terrier dog does a rat,
crushed his arm, and would have ended his life at once
if one of the natives had not appeared and quickly shot
the lion dead. In 1844 David Livingstone married the
daughter of Doctor Moffat. He went back to Scotland
several times, where he wrote many books, one of which
made him rich; but he used his wealth in further work of
discovery and the suppression of the slave-trade. In
1863 he set out on his long search for the source of the
Nile, and for seven long years amid sufferings, massacres,
atrocities, disappointments, he traveled through the
jungles of the black continent, until one day, in 1871,
Henry M. Stanley, sent out by the New York <i>Herald</i>,
appeared, &#8220;almost as an angel from heaven.&#8221; Stanley,
who lived with him in the same house, boat, and tent for
four months, said, &#8220;I never found a fault in him.&#8221;
Stanley urged him to return, but Livingstone felt his task
was unfinished, and so plunged again into the work,
writing to the New York <i>Herald</i>: &#8220;All I can add in my
loneliness is, may heaven&#8217;s rich blessing come down on
every one, American, English, or Turk, who will help to
heal the open sore of the world&#8221;&mdash;meaning the awful
slave-traffic. Not long after, an attack of pneumonia made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
him so weak that he had to be carried to a hut, where
his servants left him for the night. About four o&#8217;clock
in the morning the boy who lay at the door keeping
watch called in alarm. By the light of the candle still
burning they saw him upon his knees by his bedside, as
if in prayer. Then they knew that he had gone on his
last journey, and without a single attendant. Lovingly
his devoted servants embalmed his body and sent it to
England to be buried in Westminster Abbey with the
great of the earth. But his heart they buried by Lake
Banguilo, in the land for whose people he had toiled so
long, and for whom he gave up his life. On April 18,
1874, the great missionary-explorer was laid in his grave
in Westminster Abbey, with sorrow and yet with rejoicing,
for they knew well that his life had not been
lived in vain.</p>

<h4>16. SPURGEON, PREACHER</h4>

<p>The life-story of Charles Haddon Spurgeon is an epic
of accomplishment. The eldest of a family of seventeen
children&mdash;a true Rooseveltian family&mdash;he was born June
19, 1834, to Rev. John Spurgeon, minister of the Congregational
Church at Kilvedon, Essex County, England,
and his wife, formerly Miss Jarvis. Both parents were
earnest, devout, intellectual people who gave their children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
all that was possible to provide on a very small
salary. At an early age he went to live in the home of
his grandfather, also a Congregational minister. One day
a visiting minister, struck with the boy&#8217;s ability and
character, said, &#8220;This lad will preach the gospel to
thousands.&#8221; Having received a good education at a
private academy at Colchester, at fifteen he became an
assistant school-teacher. One Sunday, when he was sixteen,
he visited a little Methodist church and heard a
sermon on the text, &#8220;Look unto me and be ye saved.&#8221;
This sermon led to his conversion. He said, &#8220;I had been
waiting to do fifty things, but when I heard the word
&#8216;Look!&#8217; what a charming word it seemed to me.&#8221; At
seventeen he became a teacher in a classical school in
Cambridge, and was often in demand for addresses to
Sunday-school children. At eighteen he was known as
the &#8220;boy preacher,&#8221; and became minister of the Baptist
Church at Waterbeach, five miles from Cambridge, on an
annual salary of two hundred dollars. This young school-teacher
also preached at thirteen village stations maintained
by his little church. An address at a Sunday-school
anniversary was heard by a stranger, who was so
much impressed by it that he recommended this young
man as the pastor of a famous Baptist church in London,
to which he was called at the age of nineteen. He was
so eloquent, persuasive, straightforward, that he won
the hearts of his hearers, and soon all London and England
was talking of the youthful Whitefield. Within a
year the church building had to be enlarged and overflowing
congregations came to hear him in the great
Exeter Hall. Then the enlarged church proved much too
small to accommodate the crowds who flocked to hear
him. The Music Hall of Surrey Gardens, an immense
building, was rented, and it was a common thing for him
to preach to ten thousand people at one service. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
ridiculed and caricatured in merciless ways by newspapers,
ministers, and others, but his motto was, &#8220;Drive
On! Drive On!&#8221; And in his simple and earnest preaching
he drove on. In 1861 the great, classic Metropolitan
Tabernacle was opened for services. It cost one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, and seats five thousand five
hundred persons, with standing room for almost one
thousand more. For thirty years, or until his death, he
preached in the great building with every seat and all
the available standing-room occupied. His congregation
included all classes&mdash;professional men, tradesmen, dock-hands,
soldiers in their bright-red uniforms, men and
women of title, the poor outcast with the shawl over her
head, the blear-eyed drunkard, Chinamen and bronzed
Indiamen, and visitors from America and other lands&mdash;all
hanging on the words of this most popular preacher
of the world. In appearance he was not a prepossessing
man. He was below the medium height, stout, his short
hair brushed back from a low forehead, small eyes, heavy
lips, fat cheeks hanging over a heavy jaw fringed with a
short beard. He looked like a plain, every-day business
man. Instead of a white cravat he wore a little black tie.
His voice was remarkable for its sweetness and purity,
as well as its penetrating power. His language was
simple, but a massive grandeur accompanied his simplicity
of speech, which captivated every listener. There was also
a peculiar directness of address that made every hearer
feel that he was the person spoken to as a member of a
family entering into confidence with the father of the
household. Besides being &#8220;England&#8217;s greatest preacher,&#8221;
as an archdeacon of Saint Paul&#8217;s Cathedral called him,
he was a great philanthropist, commentator, administrator,
lecturer, and writer. An orphanage for boys was
begun in 1867, and one for girls in 1880, at Stockwell,
London. In these orphanages five or six hundred father-less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
children, from six to ten years, find a comfortable
home and training until they are fourteen. People of
wealth entrusted to him large gifts of money for this
philanthropic work, because they had perfect confidence
in whatever he undertook. He built a Pastor&#8217;s College,
where poor young men could receive proper training for
their work as ministers or missionaries. He also edited
a monthly magazine, &#8220;The Sword and Trowel&#8221;; wrote
commentaries; organized a colportage association; and
encouraged his wife&#8217;s &#8220;Book Fund&#8221; to provide free
gifts of books for poor pastors. He wrote and published
thirty-seven volumes of sermons and numberless tracts.
He loved to give away Bibles. He was beloved by all
denominations, and his sermons and other works, read
and admired by all classes, have been translated into many
foreign tongues. He was very happy in his home life
with his charming wife and twin sons, who became
preachers. &#8220;That word &#8216;home,&#8217;&#8221; he used to say, &#8220;rings
like a peal of wedding bells, only more sweet and low,
and it chimes deeper into the ear of the heart.&#8221; After
a short illness, this great preacher and philanthropist died,
at the age of only fifty-eight. That wonderful voice,
which for more than forty years had swayed great multitudes
with its fervid eloquence, was heard by a few
listeners to say, faint and low, and almost inarticulate,
&#8220;I have finished my course. I have kept the faith.&#8221;
These words were inscribed on his coffin of olive-wood,
the wood itself symbolic of peace.</p>


<h4>17. GRENFELL, MEDICAL MISSIONARY</h4>

<p>Where the bitter winds of the north Atlantic sweep
over the coast of Labrador, and the giant icebergs slowly
sail in their opalescent majesty through the waters of the
ocean, like phantom ships or dream palaces, lies a country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
inhabited by very poor fisherfolk, who depend upon
the scanty harvests gathered from the waters for their
living. When the &#8220;catch&#8221; is poor there is much suffering,
and the children are clothed and fed more poorly
than usual. The warm, bright days are few, and there
are no swimming holes or long, delightful summer vacations
and picnics for boys and girls.</p>

<p>Far away in merry England under its soft and sunny
skies, a boy was born in 1865&mdash;Wilfred T. Grenfell.
When he became a young medical student he heard
Dwight L. Moody, the great American evangelist, so
interpret the old, old story of Jesus in terms of loving
service for others, that he resolved to devote his life to
the poor and desolate. With such a vision of love the
young physician left his home and friends, and sailed
away up into the North Sea among the poor fishermen,
where there were no doctors to cure them when they
were ill or set their broken bones when the cruel sea
dashed them upon the rocks. Later, when others came to
help, Doctor Grenfell decided to go where no one else
cared to go. He again sailed away, this time to Labrador
and the coast of Newfoundland. How cheerless and
desolate that country appears, how far away from England
and America! Think of the coldest day and bitterest
storm you ever knew, and that is what Doctor Grenfell
found when he arrived, all alone, and where he has
worked so long and hard to make life happier and to
help the poor Eskimos understand something of the unselfish
love of the Christ-life, which is his ideal. He
found them ignorant, poor, and miserable. When they
were ill there was no one to help. When they fell over
the mountain spurs and broke their bones, they must die
or be crippled for life, for no one knew how to put the
bones in place. Along three thousand miles of coast
this good man goes in summer in his little steamboat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
fighting the cruel waves, dodging the icebergs, always in
peril, but never caring as long as he can reach the sick
and ease their pain and suffering. In winter the water is
frozen, and he must take his long, perilous journey by
sledge. With his teams of dogs hitched to his stout
sledge &#8220;Lend-a-hand,&#8221; he drives over those snow-covered
fields where there are only tall poles set up to mark a
trail, often being lost in the storms or breaking through
the ice into the waters of half-frozen streams, or being
dashed over the side of the steep path, or being buried
under an avalanche of snow from which he must dig
himself and his dogs out. But he is never discouraged.
With a keen sense of humor he sees the funny side of
things and in those cheerless, miserable homes he laughs
and tells his experiences, plays with the little ones, and
makes every one around him happy. He is Santa Claus
to the children, and &#8220;Good Samaritan&#8221; to the man by the
wayside. Often &#8220;Lend-a-hand&#8221; is his only bed, for
although the dogs are trained to watch for the poles set
to mark the path, they sometimes miss them in the storm,
and stray from the trail, and then Doctor Grenfell turns
his sledge up on the side, digs a hole in the snow, lights
a fire, and crawls into his sleeping-bag and spends the
night out-of-doors, while the dogs dig a place in the
snow for themselves, to wait for the morning light to
help them to find the lost trail. Through Doctor Grenfell
a hospital has been erected on the coast, where trained
physicians and nurses care for the poor people who are
shipwrecked or who can be taken away from their
wretched homes to be cared for. Do you wonder that
the people love this bright, cheerful Englishman, with the
endurance of a man and the tenderness of a woman, who
is translating his life into love, and trying to follow
John Wesley&#8217;s golden advice in the simple familiar
lines?</p>

<h4>18. WRIGHT BROTHERS, AVIATORS</h4>

<p>Rarely in the history of the world have two great
brothers been linked as closely together as Wilbur and
Orville Wright, the pioneers in aviation. Four years
different in age, they grew up together, studied, experimented,
invented, and dared together. Each has an equal
claim to be called the creator of the aeroplane, the Edison
of the air, the dean of birdmen, and even &#8220;the first man
to fly.&#8221; Wilbur may have been the first actually to rise
from the earth in an engine-driven, &#8220;heavier-than-air&#8221;
aeroplane, but neither of the brothers would ever make a
positive statement about it. They always spoke of themselves
as &#8220;Wright Brothers,&#8221; or &#8220;We.&#8221; Wilbur was
born near Millville, Ind., April 16, 1867; Orville, in Dayton,
Ohio, August 19, 1871. Their father was a cultured
bishop of the United Brethren Church, and their mother
was a college graduate. Both boys graduated from the
Dayton public school and high school, after which they
became printers and bicycle dealers in a dingy, common-place
little brick shop. Here fame found them. They
had no idea of flying until 1896, when they read the newspaper
report of the death of Otto Lillienthal, who, after
he had made over two thousand gliding flights in the air,
met his death by a fall. In 1900 they became intensely
interested in the experiments with air-gliders then carried
on by Professor Langley, Octave Chanute, and others.
On a country road outside of Dayton they began to fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
kites and gliders equipped with an ingenious motive-power
method of control. After this they went to Kitty
Hawk, N. C., where a number of sand-dunes made a
suitable place to glide from against the strong, steady
winds that they found necessary for their gliding tests.
They studied birds in flight and found that, in reality, a
bird is an aeroplane. The part of the wings nearest to the
body support it in the air, leaving the more flexible
portion at the extremities to flap up and down and act as
propellers. By gliding experiments they also found that
the air along the surface of the earth is continually undergoing
a churning movement, every building, hill, and
tree sending up its air wave. In 1903 they made their
first real flight of twelve seconds with their twelve horsepower
aeroplane; in 1904 they increased their flight from
one to five minutes; and in 1905 they made a hundred
and fifty flights, making twenty-four miles through the
air in thirty-eight minutes. Desiring some government
to purchase their invention, they offered it to France, only
to be refused. But two years later Wilbur sailed for
France, where he was so successful in flights that the
French Government paid him one hundred thousand dollars;
and in Italy and Germany many private sales were
made. Meanwhile Orville was flying his aeroplane at Fort
Meyer in the United States, where he succeeded in selling
a machine to the United States Government for thirty
thousand dollars. In one of his flights Orville received
a fall, which broke his thigh and caused the death of
Lieutenant Selfridge, the first victim of power-driven
aeroplanes. How both brothers ever lived through their
early flights is a matter of wonder. A part of the explanation
is to be found in their character. They proved
their scientific theories to the last point. They were
always courageous, never reckless. Unstinted praise
should be given them because they have been a conservative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
influence in the field of aviation. By precept,
example, and command, when they could command, they
fought against the recklessness of performers who have
dared death in unnecessary feats to thrill spectators at a
show. Neither in America nor in Europe did either of
them make one curve or flight for sensational effect. It
seems strange that Wilbur should have died in his bed of
typhoid fever, and not have met his death from a fall.
He died in the height of his inventive genius and glory,
leaving his brother Orville to continue the work alone.
He left a large estate as the result of their joint invention.
But best of all, he left an unsullied name. Simple,
honest, unaffected, devoted to his art, he lived, worked,
and died as becomes a true man. He was always gentle
and modest, as is his brother. The things he had done
never seemed much to him on account of the things he
intended to do. In the record of American inventions
there is no more brilliant chapter than the story of their
marvelous conquest of the air, and no matter what the
future may hold in store, the name and fame of the
Wright Brothers will live with those of Watts, Stephenson,
Howe, Arkwright, Fulton, and Edison.</p>

<h4>19. JANE ADDAMS, SETTLEMENT WORKER</h4>

<p>Among the &#8220;girls who became useful,&#8221; none can take
a higher rank than Jane Addams, the founder of &#8220;Hull
House,&#8221; a center which radiates love and good will into
the great city of Chicago. This &#8220;Palace of a Thousand
Joys&#8221; is a little city of refuge for the homeless and hopeless,
for the man without work, for the overworked
mother whose fretful children can be left to the gentle
care of the sweet-voiced helpers of Miss Addams, for
the discouraged mill-girl and factory-hand, for the old
and young of that bustling city.</p>

<p>Miss Addams was born in a home of plenty in Cedarville,
Ill., where her happy childhood was passed without
knowing poverty, as she played with her brother in
the free out-of-doors that should be the heritage of every
boy and girl in America. She was not strong, as her
spine was weak, and she had to carry her head on one
side. This was a great sorrow to her, for she was afraid
her father, a large, handsome man, would be ashamed of
his plain, crooked girl. But she found her father was
all the more tender to his frail child. He talked lovingly
to her of the equality of all, of the rich and poor, and
taught her that the duty of the rich was to help make life
happier for the poor. In this teaching of her wise, loving
father, was laid the foundation of the life-work of
this &#8220;Little Sister of the Poor.&#8221; She was so sensitive
that once when she had told an untruth she could not
sleep until she had confessed her fault to her father, who
said: &#8220;I am glad if I have a little daughter who must tell
lies, that she cannot sleep afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>She attended the village school until she went to Rockford
to a seminary, from which she graduated. Afterward
she went to Europe several times, visiting all the
great art-galleries. While in London she went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
East Side, where the poorest of England&#8217;s poor live.
She was greatly grieved by the sight of tiny children,
half-starved, with old, wizened faces, toiling from morning
until night in the mills and factories, with never a
day to play in the green fields, chasing the butterflies and
gathering wildflowers. In America she saw things that
made her sad&mdash;poverty, vice, and sorrow; little children
and weak women with tasks too heavy for them, and with
no time for pleasure or improvement. So when she
was traveling in Spain for pleasure, she suddenly resolved
to devote the rest of her life to helping the poor of her
own land. Returning to Chicago, she and her friend,
Miss Starr, took an old house that had once been a handsome
home, but was now in the midst of the poorest part
of the city. They fitted it up with comfortable furniture,
hung beautiful pictures brought from Europe on the
walls, and began the work among Chicago&#8217;s poor that
has resulted in the celebrated settlement of Hull House.
They provided a day-nursery where little children could
be cared for while their mothers were at work; reading
clubs for boys and girls; sewing clubs; a gymnasium;
an art school and kindergarten; entertainments for the
children and their fathers and mothers. Every one is
welcome to this bright, cheerful home, full of love and
good will for each and all. The Polish, Italian, and Jewish
children mingle freely together. No creed is thought of
save the creed of Jesus, &#8220;A new commandment I give
unto you, Love one another.&#8221; The children are told
stories, given care when ill, and help at all times, so that,
in the eyes of the world, &#8220;Hull House&#8221; and &#8220;Jane
Addams&#8221; now stand together for all that is best and
most helpful in philanthropy and settlement work.</p>

<p>Miss Addams&#8217; service does not cease at the door of
Hull House. She goes about the country talking to
thousands of people in the interests of better laws for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
children and better wages for women and girls. Do you
wonder that this useful woman is known by the gentle
title of &#8220;Kind Heart&#8221;?</p>


<h4>20. HELEN KELLER, MARVEL</h4>

<p>No fairy tale can be more marvelous than the story
of Helen Keller, the wonderful heroine who overcame
insurmountable obstacles before she could find her way
to mingle with her fellow men and attain her place in
the world&#8217;s work.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_286f.jpg" alt="HELEN KELLER" /></div>
<p class="caption">HELEN KELLER</p>

<p>Until she was almost a year old Helen was like other
babies&mdash;only brighter. She talked when she was six
months old, walked as early as one year, and seemed interested
in everything her baby eyes saw, and her ears
heard. But a serious illness fell upon this bright little
baby girl, and she was not expected to live. When at
last she was out of danger the light had gone from her
beautiful eyes, her tiny ears could not hear the tender
crooning of her mother&#8217;s voice, and her little tongue was
still. In darkness and silence she must pass her days, as
if some wicked fairy, had suddenly stolen the greatest
treasures of her life. At first she would lie in her
mother&#8217;s lap, as she had done while she was ill, but as she
grew older she learned to play with her little colored girl,
Martha Washington, who went everywhere with her.
She was also fond of her little dog Belle. She hunted
eggs with Martha and Belle, through the tall grass, where
the nests of the guinea-hens were, and she always wanted
to carry the eggs herself for fear Martha might fall and
break them. When she wished to go on an egg-hunt
she would double up her hands and stoop down, as if she
were feeling for something. She nodded her head for
&#8220;yes,&#8221; shook it for &#8220;no,&#8221; and shivered for cold, but she
would often become angry because she could not make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
herself understood by any one, and had to live in her
dungeon of darkness with all the beautiful things of life
shut out. She grew so unhappy in her loneliness that her
parents took her to a great specialist to learn if anything
could be done to restore her sight, speech, or hearing,
but all was hopeless. Dr. Graham Bell, of Washington,
told them what was being done for the blind, deaf, and
dumb children in Boston, in the school for the blind under
Doctor Anagnos. He secured a special teacher, Miss Anne
Sullivan, who went to live with the little &#8220;shut-in&#8221; girl
in her home in Tuscumbia, Ala. With infinite patience
the teacher taught Helen the sign-language, first spelling
the words for things in the little hand. Helen thought
this was a new kind of game, but one day when at the
pump the teacher held Helen&#8217;s hand under the spout
and spelled w-a-t-e-r as the water poured over her hand,
then Helen knew she was being taught the meaning of
words. From that moment she learned very fast. Then
she learned to touch the lips of the speaker, with her
sensitive finger-tips, and she understood what was said.
So Helen Keller came out of her house of bondage into
the wonderful world of knowledge and delight. She
could &#8220;feel&#8221; things. She could express herself. Others
could understand her. She could tell the color of a flower
she held. She learned the blind alphabet, she went to
Perkins Institute for the Blind where she learned to
read many books in the blind language. At last she
learned to speak. Then she resolved to go to college.
At length she entered Radcliffe College in Cambridge,
Mass., where she studied and listened to the lectures by
having some one who could hear spell the lecture out
into her hand. She learned, to use the typewriter and
make out her lessons. At nineteen, when she entered college,
she had accomplished what many girls of that age,
in possession of all their senses, have not accomplished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
She wrote a book of her life which was published and
brought her a great deal of money. She was a general
favorite among her schoolmates. She enjoyed her life,
and was bright, happy, and gay; having no consciousness
of being in any way handicapped. She was fond of fun,
and laughed heartily at the funny side of things. She
went to the seashore, having pleasant times in bathing.
Although still shut away in blindness and in deafness,
she lives a courageous life of usefulness in a wonderful
degree, and often entertains audiences by the story of
her life. Miss Sullivan is married, but still lives with her
and loves her as when she was a little girl who depended
on her for everything worth having in life.</p>

<p>Helen Keller, this ambitious, brilliant girl who can
neither see nor hear, has been likened to Napoleon Bonaparte
in her ability to overcome insurmountable obstacles
and attain the pinnacle of success through the
exercise of an indomitable will-power and the cooperation
of those who loved and admired the spirit and ambition
of her, whom Mark Twain called the &#8220;Marvel of the
Twentieth Century,&#8221; and of whom Edmund Clarence
Stedman sang:</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
